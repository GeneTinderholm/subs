Swear on Lord Muruga and tell me...

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,048
Are you willing to marry this girl?.

26
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,057
Yes I am willing.

27
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,720
Are you willing to marry this man?.

28
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,399
Are you feeling shy?.

29
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:52,734
If you say yes, only then this
marriage will take place.

30
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,407
Raise your head and look at me.

31
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,080
So, are you not interested
in this marriage.

32
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,750
No, I'm in love with someone.

33
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,751
She's a small girl, lets
proceed with the ceremony,...

34
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,756
... everything will be
alright after marriage.

35
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,762
See our fate, we can't live
with the person we liked...

36
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,768
... and we can't go against
the wishes of our elders.

37
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,101
I'm not worried about dying
but see we can't even die...

38
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,110
... with the person we like.

39
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,939
Let them atleast forget us
and be happy.

40
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,788
As a repentance for my sin,...

41
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,187
... I am giving half of
my property to the temple.

42
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:51,195
Such a thing should not
happen in our village again.

43
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,456
The well that they fell in
should not be opened again.

44
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,794
Here after whoever gets
married in this village,...

45
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,808
... whether rich or poor,
should swear on God...

46
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,470
...that they are
willing to get married.

47
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,814
Our family will give dowry...

48
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,213
... and conduct the
marriage in this temple.

49
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,820
After me, my generation
will take over...

50
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,981
... and do the same,
that is my wish.

51
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,826
After marriage every
thing will be fine.

52
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,485
You conduct the marriage.

53
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,495
I can't change the ritual...

54
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,498
... which has been happening
for ages in our village.

55
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,830
In every marriage that takes
place in the village,...

56
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,835
... the bride and the groom's
opinion is more important than...

57
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,837
... the parents opinion.

58
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,839
No marriage will take
place against their wishes.

59
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,841
My family will not
conduct such a marriage.

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,247
According to our village rule,...

61
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:46,513
... your daughter should
marry the man she likes.

62
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,180
Beyond this if this
marriage takes place,...

63
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,190
... your family will
be out of this village.

64
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,028
Your children's life is more
important than your life,...

65
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,030
... so instead of them
falling into the well,...

66
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,033
... the thali that is
going to bind them,...

67
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,535
... should be put into the well,
that is our village rule.

68
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,039
Open that well.

69
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,594
Snake...snake... snake....snake...

70
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,603
Why are they shouting like this?.

71
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,936
Women are bravely pouring
milk for the snake,...

72
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,941
... you men are so
scared......aaaaaaaaa

73
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,295
Madam!

74
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,141
You thought this is a bullock
cart to run across like this.

75
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,143
For the speed I travelled,...

76
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,145
... you would have been
thrown out near that hill.

77
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,648
Fools....

78
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,650
Sorry....we came running
like this because of a snake.

79
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,986
There's that snake.....Snake......

80
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,992
Kill that snake.

81
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,995
Please don't kill that snake,
it won't do anything.

82
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,333
Take your hand.

83
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:21,162
You're my servant, how dare
you hold my hand and talk.

84
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,400
What are you waiting for,
kill that snake.

85
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,347
Please don't do that....

86
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,691
O God please help....

87
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,030
Aarupadayappa please help me....

88
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,361
Amma its like a temple,
so... Just do what I say.

89
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,997
Walk like a lion
and climb the peak...

90
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,270
If you reach the peak,
climb to the sky...

91
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,286
Who are you man?.

92
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,725
Padayappa, the song was super.

93
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,563
Now...our village youngsters
are struggling to hit the pot.

94
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,568
What to do?.

95
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,399
I feel ashamed.

96
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,405
Are you going to hit
the pot or shall I go?.

97
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,575
No... I do it!
God bless you!

98
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,429
Take this!

99
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,609
- Padayappa....
- What is it?.

100
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,610
Your father.

101
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,604
- I'll tear you to pieces...
- Why are you scolding him now?.

102
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,617
Ask him why he came here,
leaving his job in the city.

103
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,618
Big collectors job...
he's working day...

104
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,623
... and night as a mechanic.

105
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,794
He has studied B.Com engineering.

106
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,129
So he should take up
some contracts and do.

107
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,457
Uncle, thats not B.Com
thats B. E. Engineering.

108
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,534
Thats what I said.

109
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,626
After studying all this why
should he work like that there.

110
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,137
Do you think I want him to
do all that work there.

111
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:13,801
If he's here, he'll be roaming
with all the fellows...

112
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,145
... and creating problems,
thats why I sent him to the city.

113
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,484
Why do you think I sent
him for such a job,...

114
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:27,491
... if he works hard only,
he'll know the meaning of life.

115
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,151
My sons what are
they doing, nothing.

116
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,498
- What about you?.
- What are you doing?.

117
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,835
He doesn't even have the
manners to answer me.

118
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,902
When elders are talking,
I should respect them.

119
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,173
- Yes thats right. Whats right?.
- Who said thats right?.

120
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,175
Hey listen to me......

121
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,507
Why are you scolding him, he's
only taken leave and come here.

122
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,174
Again he'll......

123
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,183
How do you know that
he's come on leave.

124
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,180
I wrote to him asking him
to attend my engagement.

125
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,187
I anticipated that.

126
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,693
Who gave you the
guts to do all this?.

127
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,861
Mother....

128
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,931
Who?.?.?.?.

129
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,199
Mother only asked
me to write to him.

130
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,702
Is it so?.
What, is it so?.

131
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:16,867
You have blood pressure.
Take your medicine.

132
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,544
Please have your medicines!

133
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,713
You trapped me!

134
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,874
Why are you getting
angry with me,...

135
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,884
... we wrote to him
only because he told us.

136
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,714
Nothing will happen in this
house without his consent.

137
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,550
Who is that person?.

138
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,953
Don't talk like that,
see he's looking.

139
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,565
Okay, okay, when a function
is happening in our house...

140
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,729
... I wanted him to be here.

141
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,237
That doesn't mean you have
to tell it before everyone.

142
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,743
Already your son is naughty,
if he knows that I'm soft on him,...

143
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,744
... he'll become worse.
Yehhhhhhh.....

144
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,582
Brother, you itself
asked him to come...

145
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,583
... and now your pretending
that your angry with him?.

146
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,744
Very good acting.
Teach us also to act.

147
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,754
You teach them to act.
Go from here now.

148
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,983
- Your blood pressure will shoot up.
- Shut up.

149
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,763
Wait..

150
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,003
- Do you eat well?.
- Yes father.

151
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,271
Or are you roaming about?.
No father.

152
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,609
Its a long time since
I've seen you,...

153
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,611
... thats why I asked you to come.

154
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,782
- After the function is over,
don't go immediately. - Okay.

155
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,011
- You can stay over here for a month.
- Okay.

156
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:40,015
I want to see the way
you usually salute.

157
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,957
- Not before you. Do it my son.
- No.....

158
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,963
Thats my son.

159
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,968
- Chinrasu bring my shawl.
- Yes, I'm coming.

160
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:59,034
The shawl is ready, take it.
Why did you slap me?.

161
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,972
After all I only obeyed your orders.

162
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:08,308
Don't you know that
I've changed my party?.

163
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,981
There are more party flags
than the national flag.

164
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,325
- It's late, please have your dinner.
- Let my daughter come!

165
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,826
- I'll go call her and come.
- Don't bother her, let her come.

166
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,827
- You come and have your food.
- No, let my sister come.

167
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,000
Everyone don't pamper her.

168
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,335
Only after her birth,
we became rich,...

169
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,839
... not after I married you,
so we have to wait for her.

170
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,334
What is this?.

171
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,343
We have a party meeting
today so I'm getting ready.

172
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,345
- Don't forget the verse I told you.
- No I won't.......

173
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,367
We thought you were dancing
and came running eagerly.

174
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,870
Its the tape recorder.
Okay, okay.

175
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,698
She is a modern girl,
how can you expect her...

176
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,364
... to dance classical dance?.

177
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,368
It's the jet age, you see!
Am I right dear?.

178
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,711
Green...shawl

179
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,881
What are you thinking, dear?.

180
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,385
- A six feet snake...
- Snake....snake.....where

181
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,723
When I just uttered the word
you people are shivering.

182
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:26,057
One guy caught it in his hand
and even kissed it.

183
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,731
- What a brave man!
- Who is it madam?.

184
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,904
His name is Padayappa.

185
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,902
Oh. Its Arupadayappan.
You mean.... him.

186
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,907
When he was only six years old,
he held a snake in his hand.

187
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,077
He's my sister son.
Didn't you tell her?.

188
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,080
In your childhood,
you used to play with him.

189
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,410
Is Padayappa educated?.

190
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,753
He is the only person
in this village,...

191
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,913
... who is equally educated as you.

192
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,923
He's very sensible,
smart, enthusiastic.....

193
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,925
He is a very nice boy!

194
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,111
- Take that flower off your head.
- No, madam it was very pretty...

195
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,782
I said take it off.
Put it down.

196
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:37,128
Whatever blooms, grows
and even what I see is mine.

197
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:43,202
If anyone else trys to take it,
this is what will happen.

198
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,977
I'll destroy it.

199
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,146
Go bring coffee.

200
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,988
Nothing mother.

201
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,214
Nothing, now we have
nothing with us.

202
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,484
Once upon a time,
we had all the luxuries...

203
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,993
... but all we have
now is our honour.

204
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,235
So don't long for anything.

205
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,507
We can only water the flower,...

206
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,839
... don't desire to
keep it on your head.

207
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,512
Okay, go and give coffee.

208
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,852
Wait...turn.

209
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,027
You may go now...

210
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,889
- Who is that girl?.
- Girl!?.

211
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,058
So, so long you played the
organ thinking of a girl.

212
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,227
Then, you want him to think of you?.

213
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,888
- Who is that girl?. Thats what
I'm asking?. - Which girl?.

214
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,065
That girl standing when
I caught the snake.

215
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,901
Your uncle's daughter.

216
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,563
You don't even have an
uncle! She's your cousin.

217
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,066
- What?. My uncle's daughter?.
- Yes.

218
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,075
Yes, she has studied abroad.

219
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,078
She is a very arrogant
and bold woman.

220
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,907
She doesn't seem like that.

221
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,243
Don't you know the way she
came and got down from the car.

222
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,917
That girl came by flight,
and the car came by ship.

223
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,590
Can't imagine the
way she's behaving.

224
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,918
I'm not talking about that girl,
I'm talking about the other girl.

225
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,258
- What are you blabbering?.
- It's Sanskrit.

226
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,267
It is the language of the Gods.

227
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,104
There are three types of women,...

228
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,272
... Sathvigam,
prachothagam, bhayanakam.

229
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,112
We don't understand anything.

230
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,941
- Explain to us!
- I'll explain.

231
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,950
I'll tell you, if you feel
like worshiping a girl...

232
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,283
... when you see her,
its called sathvigam.

233
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:16,283
When you see a girl,
if you feel like......its called

234
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,358
- We've understood.
- lndeed! It's 'Prachotakam'

235
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,294
When you see a girl, if you get
scared its called 'bhayanakam'.

236
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,301
Okay Padayappa, tell me
which category the girl...

237
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,363
... you saw belongs to.

238
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:36,140
Sathvigam. The girl who thanked
me when I saved the snake.

239
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,650
From the time I saw her,
I've lost my heart.

240
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,991
Sathukudi..... No.....
Sambar....... No...

241
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,664
Is it sathvigam?.
Yes. Then call her.

242
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,669
Where's my mouth organ?.
Its in your hand.

243
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,069
- He really loves that girl.
- Then we'll get them married.

244
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,034
Give an idea.

245
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,039
I'm not ldea Mani,
to give an idea immediately,

246
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,041
But he is no more!

247
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,371
How did he die?.

248
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,044
He died after drinking
illicit liquor.

249
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,050
Not only him, 18 people
died in our village.

250
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,051
What?.
Illicit liquor in our village.

251
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:54,057
All this happened
only in your absence.

252
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,060
Illicit liquor, prostitution...

253
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:01,224
... and gambling is
now very common here.

254
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,064
Who dares to do all these things?.

255
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,464
All in your family only.

256
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,241
Your uncle's sons are doing this.

257
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,077
Because they are your brothers...

258
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,078
... people are scared
to tell your father.

259
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,748
Do you know the rogues who
ran away fearing you,...

260
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,750
... have come back again
because of your brothers.

261
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:27,087
Padayappa please
listen to me, don't go.

262
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:37,091
Don't prevent me.
My path is different.

263
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,469
How dare you prepare illicit liquor?.

264
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,311
How dare you indulge
in prostitution?.

265
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,151
Just think of the
family you were born in.

266
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,485
If I see you like this again,
I'll thrash wherever I see you.

267
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,492
- What did I say?.
- You'll thrash wherever you see us.

268
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,320
- He is my friend, Alagapuram Alagesan.
- This face!?.

269
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,160
My friend will now
close his eyes,...

270
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,328
... when he opens you both
should not be seen here.

271
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,340
- One......
- They have vanished.

272
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:56,344
That's Padayappa.
Now people will have that fear in you.

273
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,513
- Sathvigam is coming.
Where?. Where?. - There.

274
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,196
Come on!

275
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,356
You won't get another
chance like this,...

276
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:20,370
... that girl is coming alone
so tell her about your love...

277
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,373
... ask her if she likes you too,...

278
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:27,377
... if she says yes
just hug and kiss her.

279
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,880
Will you do it correctly?.

280
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,614
Please don't make a mess of it.
Okay we'll go and hide.

281
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:38,887
Wait a minute, Padayappa wants
to talk to you so please wait.

282
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,385
- Oh no!
- Don't get scared, its a simple matter.

283
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,222
No, I'm very scared.

284
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:49,226
Then you seem to have
something in mind.

285
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,231
No, no nothing like that.

286
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,894
Then go and talk.
Go..... He's waiting......

287
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,907
Alright!

288
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,253
You wanted to talk
something with me....

289
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,256
Oh God!
He has messed it up!

290
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,429
Nothing.... Nothing is there?.

291
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:24,667
No nothing.
Then can I go?. You can go.

292
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,277
- Padayappa you spoilt the whole thing.
- What did I do?.

293
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,609
How much we told you.
What did you say?.

294
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,447
- Will you ask when we said?.
- When did you say it?.

295
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,678
Padayappa, we were
coming like this...

296
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,279
... and that girl
was walking towards

297
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,948
I can't explain everything again.

298
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,290
- Give that to him.
- What is this?.

299
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,463
- Love letter.
- Oh! That girl gave me?.

300
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,458
You only should write.

301
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:01,469
Me?. Here hold this,
let me tell you what to write.

302
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,300
Yes, tell me now, when you
meet her don't open your mouth.

303
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,966
Bend... now tell me.

304
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,978
Say it!

305
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:33,326
Yours lovingly, Padayappa.
Put your signature.

306
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,510
Take care else it may tear.

307
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,679
- Go give it and come.
- Me?. You go and give it yourself.

308
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,345
I can't go.
I'm not in love your the one.

309
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,515
- Aren't my friend?. Won't you
do this for me?. - Okay,come.

310
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,349
Wait. Tomorrow is an
auspicious day for Lord Muruga.

311
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,526
-... so lets give it tomorrow.
- This is the limit.

312
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,528
This is love, I'm going
to start a new life.

313
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,755
It's necessary to be sentimental
in these matters, isn't it?.

314
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,761
Now you'll talk well,
come there we'll see.

315
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,938
Give a lot of hay for the cow,
it'll give some extra milk.

316
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,037
Why are you whiling away your time?.

317
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,777
Are you here?.
I want to ask you something?.

318
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,711
If you put your hand into
the snake pit won't it bite?.

319
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:26,546
- What?.
- Didn't the snake bite Padayappa?.

320
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,727
- Go and ask him that question.
- Okay, I'll ask him.

321
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,074
Madam, please go inside, this
cow gets attracted to red color.

322
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,578
I can't were the
color the cow likes.

323
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,079
I'll do as I please, you
mind your own business.

324
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,421
Madam, please go inside.

325
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,769
Madam the cow......
Someone please help....

326
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,133
Bravo!

327
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,652
Did you give the letter?.
No.... Then give it now. Okay.

328
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,830
When your giving it mention
my name and give it.

329
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:17,156
- Okay...
- Think of God while giving.

330
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,499
Stupid not now, while giving.

331
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,831
Padayappa, come inside.
Yes, coming.

332
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,516
Padayappa asked me to
give you something.

333
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,179
- What?.
- This letter.

334
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,852
- Get a cup of coffee.
- Please help him God!

335
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:49,189
- Thanks for saving her life.
- Uncle, don't get emotional.

336
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:54,694
If something happens to
her, I can't bear it.

337
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,706
She is very dear to me!

338
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,209
- Ask him to sit.
- I forgot!

339
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,878
- Welcome sir.
- Didn't the snake bite you that day.

340
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,547
You don't bite him now.
You sit. He's my son's Secretary.

341
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,721
Welcome Padayappa, how are you?.

342
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,548
Fine. Your going to
be my brother-in-law.

343
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,957
- Is everyone fine at home?.
- Yes.

344
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,565
Mother asked if we have
to do anything special...

345
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,224
... for the engagement.

346
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,570
The girl itself is special
to us. So no formalities.

347
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,898
Am I right, Prakash?.

348
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,575
He's going to be a
groom so he's shy.

349
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,245
So how is your politics?.

350
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,581
This time they have
agreed to give me a seat.

351
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:43,914
You go inside and do your work.
She's very absentminded.

352
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,256
Have you seen your engagement dress?.

353
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,592
Yesterday I saw it.
It looks fine.

354
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,752
- Thats not yours, thats mine.
- No I saw it yesterday.

355
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,921
Try to understand what I'm saying.

356
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,762
Okay, okay.
I have some work so I'll take leave.

357
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,269
Even I have some work...sit down.

358
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,274
You carry on.

359
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,610
- Don't stand for everything.
- You didn't answer me.

360
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,970
Why do you respect
these servants?. Sit.

361
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,036
What are you waiting for?.
Keep it and go!

362
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,065
The fault is with me.
Don't get angry with her.

363
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,826
Girls should have
patience not anger....

364
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:08,065
...obedience not arrogance,
calm and not hasty.

365
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,841
A woman should be humble
and not audacious.

366
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:17,079
Altogether a girl should
behave like a girl.

367
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,358
It's believed that arrogant
women can't lead a happy life.

368
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,711
Since you want us
to walk like you,...

369
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,716
... do we have to walk behind you.

370
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,718
Today is his day so let him enjoy.

371
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,717
We feel very bad about it.

372
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,722
Why?. If Padayappa is
the man of power,...

373
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,724
... I am man of beauty.

374
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,729
The girl has escaped.....
Why do you say that?.

375
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,061
That girl will commit
suicide if she marries you.

376
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,900
Now if she see's you like this
she will refuse to marry you.

377
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,897
Padayappa, you give me your dress.
Ask someone else.

378
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,737
Only this dress looks good.

379
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,745
Then what will I wear.
You wear mine.

380
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,747
I can't. Padayappa my
marriage is important...

381
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,749
...or your dress is important.

382
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,910
How will that girl marry me.

383
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,747
Thats right.
Why don't you wash it and wear?.

384
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,923
If I have the time
why should I ask you.

385
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,151
Remove the dress.

386
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,927
We have to walk all the way...

387
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,433
... atleast we could
have taken a jeep.

388
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,602
Who will give us bride
if we go by jeep.

389
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,434
We should go by Benz
or Plymouth or else go walking.

390
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:54,108
- Are you going to see the bride.
- Why?. Have they gone away.

391
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,446
That's a good joke!
Is he the bridegroom?.

392
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,112
He's the bridegroom but the
dress he's wearing is mine.

393
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,951
- Thats why he looks good.
- Okay. Come, come.

394
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,790
Are you going to see the bride,
who's the bridegroom?.

395
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:11,458
He's the bridegroom but the
dress he's wearing is mine.

396
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,797
Thats why he looks tip top.

397
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,800
Padayappa I am only
the bridegroom...

398
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,801
... but this dress is mine.
Okay.

399
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,962
Who is the bridegroom in this crowd?.

400
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,473
He's the bridegroom but the
dress he's wearing is not mine.

401
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,207
Did he ask you about this dress?.

402
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,146
Don't talk about this
dress anymore. Okay.

403
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,815
The brides house is on this side.

404
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,820
There's some problem
with this glasses.

405
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,823
The bride is waiting
for you for a long time.

406
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:45,485
He's the bridegroom but l
won't talk about this dress.

407
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,828
Come here, come closer!

408
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,835
Padayappa, this dress is yours...

409
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,496
... but please forget about this dress.
Come lets go.

410
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,503
Who is the bridegroom in this crowd?.

411
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,846
You ask them yourself?.

412
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,844
Tell them...

413
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,180
He's the bridegroom but I forgot
about the dress he's wearing.

414
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,853
I think the bridegroom is mad.
Come lets go.

415
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,528
I don't want this dress
neither the marriage,...

416
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,530
... I'll remain a
bachelor all my life.

417
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,538
Don't worry Alagesa, the bride
will definitely like you.

418
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,873
If the bride agrees,
we'll fix the marriage immediately.

419
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:38,037
Padayappa, what you've
arranged to see so many girls.

420
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,877
You're very lucky select
any one from this.

421
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,226
I want to talk with you personally.

422
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,240
As soon as that girl signaled
all those girls vanished.

423
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,243
Don't disgust me before her.
Go from here.

424
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,240
This girl is dangerous
thats why we didn't go.

425
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,317
Don't get angry, we'll go.

426
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,920
Beware!

427
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:21,250
- You're very lucky.
- Why?. - Because I like you.

428
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:27,928
Seeing my beauty,
status and talent,...

429
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:32,935
... many guys more educated
than you liked me,...

430
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,267
... not only here but also abroad.

431
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,602
I was not interested
in them but I like you.

432
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,279
Aren't you lucky?.

433
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:46,947
In my childhood days I believe
I've played with you,...

434
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,951
... but I don't remember.

435
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,952
The world is changing
at a fast pace,...

436
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,287
... only fools remember old things.

437
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,120
I don't know why, when you saved
the snake I liked your bravery.

438
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,135
When you fought to
ban illicit liquor...

439
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:10,139
... I liked your anger,
And I admired your valour!

440
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,142
When you adviced me in my house

441
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,145
I admired the way you talk.

442
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:22,141
Most of all I like your style.

443
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,156
I admire your five
different faces,...

444
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:32,321
... your very lucky because
your the one I like.

445
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,989
I want every thing to be the
best in my life, my car,...

446
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:41,003
... dress, bungalow
and even my dog...

447
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,007
... and the man going to marry,
I want the best....

448
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:48,010
... I want to marry
someone like you...

449
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,411
... and stand before
my friends and society.

450
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,410
In your sisters engagement,
you express our wish.

451
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,422
You'll feel shy so I'll say it myself.
Bye.

452
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,444
You expressed your wish,
let me tell mine.

453
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,380
I'm not interested in marrying you.

454
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:41,224
You want to marry a man,
I want to marry a woman.

455
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,397
And that woman is not you.

456
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,073
Are you in love with someone?.

457
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:03,075
I usually don't desire for
anything but if I do,...

458
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:07,249
... I don't rest without getting it.

459
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:12,092
I'll definitely get you.

460
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:20,260
Baby, you said you've
seen my five faces....

461
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:27,266
I have another face,
don't see it, you'll regret it.

462
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,113
You'll never succeed!

463
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,116
You don't know about me.

464
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:40,779
My path is unique,
don't disturb that.

465
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:47,286
May I know the girl you love?.

466
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,183
Why do I have to wear a garland?.

467
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,581
Then only you'll look
like a bridegroom.

468
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:54,353
Everything is fine but we could
have had a small vocal concert.

469
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,591
- So what, I'll sing.
- What, you want to sing?.

470
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:02,361
- You thought my style is old?.
- You sing brother, old is gold.

471
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:08,375
- No, no, see he's sulking.
- Lets ask Padayappa to sing.

472
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,545
- Atleast today give that letter.
- Definitely I'll give it today.

473
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,879
Padayappa, your father's calling.

474
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,558
- What sort of a dress is this?.
- That's my style!

475
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:32,391
- Sing a song! - Me!?.
- They asked you to sing.

476
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,569
You have learnt music
formally, haven't you?.

477
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,400
Even your daughter
knows to dance,...

478
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,572
... Iet her dance
then my son will sing.

479
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:48,907
Are we going to have a competition?.

480
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,920
What rubbish?.

481
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,419
My sister refuses to dance.
Perhaps she has forgotten.

482
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:55,925
Son-in-law!
I mean, brother...

483
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,927
She's very moody so........

484
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:11,604
What a surprise!

485
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,675
How are you going to
manage such a huge crowd?.

486
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,951
After all we too have learnt music.

487
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,621
- What's this?.
- What's the matter?.

488
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:29,952
My son can manage
bigger crowd than this.

489
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,295
Make way!

490
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,296
- lsn't it Padayappa?.
- Thats right mother.

491
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,303
I'm ready to dance.

492
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,631
Even my son is ready to sing.
Isn't it son?.

493
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,974
- Yes father.
- Ask him to begin then.

494
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:08,355
She has studied in America
so she's very broadminded,...

495
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,360
... why are you
scolding him for that?.

496
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:15,027
He's not a baby, if that
girl has behaved like that...

497
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:19,034
... in front of thousand people,
there must be a reason.

498
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,701
- He hasn't done anything.
- Then, who did?.

499
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,704
- I need not say that.
- I'll slap you!

500
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,037
Why are you waiting, he'll keep
scolding you if your here.

501
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:33,045
Take care of yourself,
go care fully, eat properly...

502
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,380
...sleep at the right time.

503
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:41,054
Don't pamper him, did you give
those sweets you made for him.

504
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,392
- I forgot. - Go and get it.
- I'll bring it and come.

505
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:48,053
Did you pack his sweaters,
it'll be cold there.

506
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,395
I forgot.
Go bring it and come.

507
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:55,067
Go to bed early, don't
roam about in the nights.

508
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,134
Father, the village
elders have to see you.

509
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,409
Allow me to talk to him, will you?.
Okay, I'll come.

510
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,077
Son, come a week earlier
for your sister's marriage.

511
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,083
Don't worry about
anything I'll take care.

512
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:11,413
Its getting late you leave.

513
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,917
Good day, sir.
Welcome, welcome.

514
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:20,088
Whats the occasion?.
Why have you'll gathered here?.

515
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,759
You could have called
for me instead.

516
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:31,430
We've come to talk about
your family matter,...

517
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:37,936
... you are V. I. P.in this village.

518
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:45,452
What son, have you
done anything wrong?.

519
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,791
- No Father.
- lts not about him but about you.

520
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,187
There is a complaint on you.

521
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,127
Complaint on me?.
Who has given?.

522
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,207
Your brother only has given.

523
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,804
Father, father....

524
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,989
What has he accused me of?.

525
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,819
The property which
belongs to both...

526
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,483
... is being enjoyed only by you...

527
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,824
... and that you are lavish
in village activities.

528
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,497
Why are you keeping quiet?.

529
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,500
Nothing brother....

530
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,999
After giving the complaint,
why do you call him brother.

531
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,841
Ages ago two people
committed suicide...

532
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:43,845
... so my grandfather gave half
the property to the temple....

533
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:50,011
...and the rest is being used
for the welfare of the village.

534
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:55,023
I have three children,
don't I have to get them...

535
00:54:55,091 --> 00:55:00,028
... married in a rich family?.

536
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:07,025
I don't get the same respect
as he gets in this village.

537
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,198
- They treat us a dump.
- It depends on each one's behaviour.

538
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,200
Why?.

539
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,869
- Proceed!
- What nonsense are you talking?.

540
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:19,208
I wanted to get my daughter
married to that rich man's son.

541
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,550
But before that he fixed
it for his daughter.

542
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,886
Atleast I thought I'll fix
my son for his daughter,...

543
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,046
... the way that girl
behaved yesterday,...

544
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,886
... I know even not going to happen.

545
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:33,051
Don't talk about all that,
tell your decision.

546
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,562
I want my share of
the property divided.

547
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,907
Brother, what do you mean?.

548
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,908
Only if I have money
people will respect me...

549
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:52,573
... and can get my children
married in a rich family.

550
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,084
You divide the property.

551
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,253
Are you sure you want
the property divided?.

552
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,914
Won't your brother
give you, if you ask?.

553
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,092
I'm not a beggar to go and ask him.

554
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,921
I was also born of my
mother not for someone else.

555
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,598
Yes, you were not
born for my mother.

556
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,107
You've provoked me to talk!

557
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:27,109
Your mother gave
birth to you and died.

558
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:33,286
I brought you to my house and
asked my mother to look after...

559
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,291
...you as she did to me.

560
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,962
She promised me that she would
never reveal this to anyone.

561
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:49,298
Till now no one knows about this,
I have not even told my wife.

562
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:53,142
Even you know it only now.

563
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:59,974
Only this man knows about this.

564
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,985
He was there when our father died.

565
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:17,394
Tell me brother, have l
ever called you by name,...

566
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,659
I pampered you so much!

567
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,406
... I love you so much...

568
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:31,413
... but you love only this property.

569
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,185
Everyone listen to me,...

570
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:41,189
... till I'm alive no on has the
right to divide this property.

571
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:45,027
Why should I divide it?.

572
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,355
Let my brother take everything.

573
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:52,194
I don't want a penny
from this property.

574
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,435
You take everything.
I will sign all the papers and give you.

575
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:01,202
If you don't have
anything what will you do?.

576
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,716
My only treasure is my son.

577
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,385
When he's there why
should I be bothered.

578
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:18,387
I've bought a piece of land in
the money he sent every month.

579
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:23,392
We will manage with that.

580
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:29,405
I don't mind living in a hut.

581
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,075
I'll prove my worth!

582
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,267
How am I going to
conduct this marriage?.

583
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,305
Go my son, from now on we are
all are at the back of you.

584
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,472
No father, you are
always our leader.

585
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,500
Wait, put the witness
signature and then go.

586
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,331
Padayappa, I know you'll
take care of your sister.

587
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,172
Make sure you take the
responsibilities which our...

588
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,840
... family has
undertaken from the past.

589
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,351
That's very important.

590
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:32,855
Wait a minute, let me sit
here for one last time.

591
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:14,563
What are you doing like a small child.
Come lets go.

592
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,569
- Father!
- Let's go!

593
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,589
Go and console your mother.

594
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,678
Are you still thinking of father.

595
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,454
I know your worried
about sister's marriage.

596
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,455
Don't worry I'll take care of that.

597
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,284
Padayappa, without
anyone's knowledge...

598
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:10,950
... your uncle's son
is getting married.

599
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:20,967
Who let all them inside?.
Ask everyone to get out.

600
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,650
Move everybody.

601
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:39,313
Its only a week since
your brother's death,...

602
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,653
... how can you do such
a thing in his house.

603
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:47,485
Stupid man, this is my house.

604
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:50,498
Why should I perform his last rites?.

605
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,001
Mind your own business.

606
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,670
How can you get you son
married to his daughter,...

607
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:57,729
... when he is engaged to this girl.

608
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:05,337
Yes, we engaged that girl to my
son when their family was rich.

609
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,516
How can I get my son married
to a family which is poor.

610
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,746
What will happen to
my family status.

611
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:14,015
I'm not a fool to get my
son married in this family.

612
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,760
Money will go and come anytime
but only relatives stay the last.

613
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:22,524
When your sister is like this,
how can you do such a thing.

614
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,532
Is wealth more important to you.

615
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:28,693
That's my wish, because l
wanted a break in politics...

616
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:32,707
... and since her father
had political influence...

617
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,709
... I agreed to marry her.

618
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:41,539
Now he's no more so
I changed my place.

619
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,382
I agreed not because I liked her.

620
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,559
Whatever the case may be,
according to our village rule...

621
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,560
... the marriage is
supposed to take place in...

622
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,562
...the temple with the bride...

623
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,564
... and the groom expressing
their wish to marry.

624
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,396
... and only then is the
marriage to be conducted.

625
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:04,403
- For how long?.
- Why waste time in arguments?.

626
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:11,413
Look, don't try to dominate us.
I spare you because of my sister.

627
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,434
God bless you!

628
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,602
She herself has
blessed the couple,...

629
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,440
... you people can go
and have your food now.

630
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:46,615
We are not so shameless
as to eat your food.

631
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:50,775
We're not beggars.
Come lets go, Padayappa.

632
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,788
If you don't eat, the food
is not going to get wasted.

633
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,620
Come, why are you so late?.

634
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:06,465
We were running out of time
since it was an urgent marriage.

635
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:10,799
I know you married only because
your parents forced you to.

636
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,476
Aren't you ashamed to
marry you don't like.

637
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,636
People like you encourage
such kind of male chauvinists.

638
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,648
Are you a man?.
Shame on you.

639
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:24,813
How selfish of you to
think only about yourself.

640
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,485
Oh! Are you still
thinking of Padayappa?.

641
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,487
I'll get you married to a
better person than Padayappa.

642
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,661
Why see other guys, see my sons.

643
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,831
You don't worry, I'll bring
thousand men for you to select.

644
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:39,895
You can bring thousand men but can
you find one man like Padayappa.

645
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:46,504
I'll marry only Padayappa.
No one can change this.

646
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,683
Why are you weeping like a child?.

647
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,846
But you're a child, aren't you?.
Eat this!

648
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,690
Mother is old so she weeps,
but why should you...

649
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,527
He should only cry,...

650
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:09,690
... for not being fortunate
enough to have you as his wife.

651
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:11,699
You don't cry, sister.

652
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,864
What big money, have we not
enjoyed all the luxuries in life.

653
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,539
See how grandly I'll
conduct your marriage.

654
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,204
I'll do more than what
father desired to do.

655
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:27,215
You eat.

656
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:33,711
I'll select a better man than him,
more educated, smart,...

657
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:39,728
... intelligent, good looking
and a man of your choice...

658
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,958
... but I can't get
the man you desired.

659
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:48,570
Alas! I can't get you
the man of your dreams!

660
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,575
I'm helpless dear!

661
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,741
Don't cry.....don't cry.

662
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,747
What will be our plight
if you lose heart?.

663
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,922
God is there to help
us so don't cry.

664
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,266
Please don't cry, my dears!

665
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:23,260
- Feed her.
- Eat my dear. - Eat my dear!

666
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:44,622
Why are you talking in English?.
Talk in tamil?.

667
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,786
This is granite stone.

668
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,957
I suspected it when
I saw it glitter.

669
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,636
Have you started your
family tradition?.

670
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,634
If you keep doing this,...

671
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,969
... you'll have to handover
the property to us.

672
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,306
Fools! do you know what
stone is that?. Granite.

673
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,479
So what?.

674
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,308
Idiots, you don't know
the value of this.

675
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,815
Drunkards, Padayappa has
a mountain of granites.

676
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:15,323
If he comes to know of this,
he can even buy the...

677
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,325
... villages surrounding us.

678
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,662
Now do you realise why l
gave that money to him.

679
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,831
Stupid fellows.

680
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,333
I shut his mouth for the time-being.

681
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:27,502
Okay, now what are you
going to do about it?.

682
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,504
Where is my brother's photo
which was hanging there?.

683
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,832
- You asked me to put it away.
- Hang it back there.

684
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:37,334
- Why?. - When we want their
favour, we need to do all this.

685
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,684
Brother, how can I forget you?.
Why are you crying father?.

686
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:45,353
I've just started acting,
stupid fellow, come.

687
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,689
Everyday brother
comes in my dream...

688
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,849
... and slaps me
exactly at 1 1 O'clock.

689
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,025
He treated me like his own...

690
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,699
... and gave me all the property...

691
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:02,032
... but his children
are struggling here.

692
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:06,704
- It's just a night mare.
- No it is not!

693
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:12,873
No, please come back to our house
otherwise you can't see me alive.

694
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,050
I will write all the property
back in your name.

695
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:18,052
It's your property any way.

696
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,719
You needn't come today, tomorrow
you can come after I handover...

697
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,054
... everything to you
in the register office.

698
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,117
Believe me, Padayappa!

699
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:30,057
See, I told you that your father
will never see us struggle.

700
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,400
See how he has changed him.

701
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,403
No mother.

702
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:39,400
Why should we struggle
here like this my son,...

703
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,073
... we'll go back to our house.

704
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,912
Let your father come
and tell this in your dream.

705
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:50,912
- Shut up. - Padayappa I'm like
your father, listen to me.

706
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,088
Believe me, son!

707
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,923
You may beat me for
the blunder I've made.

708
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,760
Fine, I'll beat myself!

709
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:02,761
- Stop it!
- I won't stop till he forgives me.

710
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,933
Is the slipper a new one?.
Is that very important now?.

711
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,934
Please believe me.

712
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,098
If mother agree's l
have nothing to say.

713
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:16,103
Thanks a lot. I'll transfer
all the property to your name.

714
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,446
Then I'll take leave.

715
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:21,775
Why don't you write this
piece of land in my name?.

716
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:29,117
I'll build a tomb in memory
of my dear brother...

717
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:33,127
... and worship him all my life.

718
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,797
Shall we fix the
registration tomorrow?.

719
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,964
Stop this nonsense!
Where is the party?.

720
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:42,799
My brother's tractor is an old one.

721
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,480
They are not coming in
Benz car like us,...

722
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,482
... the tractor is bad,
the road is bad.

723
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,978
More than that those
two guys are bad.

724
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,988
We can't go by the main road,
go through the village.

725
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,491
The registrar will be there
only for half an hour.

726
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,828
Come late in the Morning
and go early in the evening.

727
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,991
What happened?.
The bearing is cut.

728
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,000
It'll take atleast an
hour to set it right.

729
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:19,830
Don't go sir. Wait.....
Why are you so late?.

730
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:24,845
We came through a lot of hurdles.

731
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,015
Don't answer like school children.

732
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,843
We're only saying the truth!

733
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,019
Since its late the registrar
has gone home, so we'll have...

734
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,179
... the registration
tomorrow at our house.

735
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,257
Fine!

736
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:39,258
Everyone has signed in their
family, Mr.Aarupadayappan.

737
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,030
Go, son!

738
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,883
Catch it.
Catch it.

739
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:06,043
Collect all the important documents.

740
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,892
Close all the windows.

741
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:24,072
Stop my son.
Don't sign.

742
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:30,071
This is the third time
we are facing a hurdle.

743
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:35,076
I don't think it's a good omen!

744
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:39,246
Let them keep the property.

745
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:44,080
- Come lets go.
- Alright! - Please wait.

746
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:47,925
I want to fulfil my brother's dream.

747
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,931
We have all signed,
what do I do with the papers now.

748
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,260
- Tear it off?.
- Explain to them!.

749
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,603
You please tear it!

750
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:58,265
Padayappa from the time you
beat them they are like this.

751
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,939
If there's a wind it'll blow.

752
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:07,605
The tractor was old so it broke
down don't take this as a reason.

753
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:11,115
Whatever you say,
please let us go.

754
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:14,622
My mother has decided,
so please let us go.

755
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,958
Let's go!

756
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,636
I think you desire something else?.

757
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,965
I need that piece of land
you now or not even that...

758
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:36,136
... I just need that small hill
in the middle of the land.

759
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,312
Why do you need that alone?.

760
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,974
With that alone, I can
buy the whole village.

761
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,151
Why did someone tell you,
there is a treasure?.

762
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:48,312
That's not an ordinary hill,
that hill is made of granite.

763
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:58,997
- Only that god has helped us.
- Better bestow that hill to me.

764
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:04,004
- Otherwise?. - My sons are
not worthy to beat you...

765
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:09,169
... so I've set up
people from outside.

766
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,011
Padayappa, don't make it
too long, finish them...

767
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,414
... and come home quickly.
Okay mother.

768
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,187
Alright, mother!

769
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,740
Where are you going?.
Please complete the formalities.

770
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,076
Let me go!

771
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,484
Gone are the days when people
were treated as slaves!

772
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:37,158
Slaves are non-existent these days.

773
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:42,489
You'll suffer for the
sins you've committed.

774
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:47,324
I don't interfere with
anyone but if they do.

775
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:59,180
I think you understand.

776
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:05,512
My path is unique, don't forget.

777
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:18,855
Go and ask forgiveness.

778
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:25,533
Padayappa, please forgive me.

779
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:32,873
Forgiveness is only to those
who sin unintentionally.

780
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:38,383
I'll even forgive my
deadly enemy but not you.

781
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,620
Don't ever face me again
for the rest of your life.

782
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,624
If you do, you won't be alive.

783
1:22:06,649 --> 1:22:09,015
Please wait, I want to talk to you.

784
1:22:09,652 --> 1:22:16,956
I don't know how to tell you
the first time I saw you,...

785
1:22:18,061 --> 1:22:21,030
... I fell in love with you.

786
1:22:21,097 --> 1:22:27,798
I get nervous whenever I see you!

787
1:22:27,870 --> 1:22:34,639
I decided that I'll marry only you.

788
1:22:40,083 --> 1:22:43,814
Even now I'm telling you,
I won't leave you.

789
1:23:01,370 --> 1:23:03,838
If you ask her directly,
how will she tell you.

790
1:23:04,040 --> 1:23:07,066
Write a letter, she'll reply back.

791
1:23:07,710 --> 1:23:09,678
For the past two years,
he's been giving that letter.

792
1:23:09,879 --> 1:23:12,848
What to do, I don't
get the opportunity.

793
1:23:13,049 --> 1:23:18,077
- Shut up, you'll never give.
- I'll definitely give it today.

794
1:23:18,387 --> 1:23:20,355
Let's see.

795
1:23:36,072 --> 1:23:39,041
- Why have you come?.
- Is your mother there?.

796
1:23:39,142 --> 1:23:41,042
- Yes. Why?. - I want to meet her.
- You can't.

797
1:23:41,410 --> 1:23:43,378
Brother, why are you
standing outside, come in.

798
1:23:43,913 --> 1:23:45,881
Now can I go inside?.

799
1:23:47,416 --> 1:23:49,714
- How are you?.
- Fine brother. - Go inside.

800
1:23:52,922 --> 1:23:54,719
There's no point in
wearing a shawl,...

801
1:23:54,790 --> 1:23:56,724
... if you don't
know how to wear it.

802
1:23:57,760 --> 1:23:59,728
Always put it the right way.

803
1:24:01,164 --> 1:24:03,724
How did you hold the snake?.

804
1:24:06,936 --> 1:24:09,063
- Let's go inside.
- Why?.

805
1:24:09,138 --> 1:24:11,072
- We'll see what they've come for.
- Your right sometimes.

806
1:24:13,943 --> 1:24:15,740
What brother, everyone's
seeing the house...

807
1:24:15,811 --> 1:24:17,745
... and your looking at the floor?.

808
1:24:20,116 --> 1:24:23,085
Brother, why are you crying?.
What happened?.

809
1:24:23,786 --> 1:24:25,913
My daughter's life is in your hands.

810
1:24:26,122 --> 1:24:28,090
Why?.
Tell me what happened?.

811
1:24:28,791 --> 1:24:32,750
- You know how much I love
my daughter. - Yes, I do!

812
1:24:32,962 --> 1:24:35,157
Her life is in your hands now.

813
1:24:35,798 --> 1:24:38,426
Is my face worse than a servant.

814
1:24:55,818 --> 1:24:58,446
She's very adamant about
marrying only Padayappa.

815
1:24:59,488 --> 1:25:02,457
I couldn't convince
her regarding this.

816
1:25:02,992 --> 1:25:06,120
If we leave her like this,
she'll die of depression.

817
1:25:07,830 --> 1:25:12,199
Please accept her as
your daughter-in-law.

818
1:25:13,002 --> 1:25:18,963
Please don't let my sister
suffer for what I did.

819
1:25:19,175 --> 1:25:26,138
Please don't spoil her life.
I'll fall on your feet.

820
1:25:26,849 --> 1:25:28,817
Don't worry brother,...

821
1:25:28,884 --> 1:25:33,821
... tomorrow I'll come to your
house to fix the marriage.

822
1:25:39,195 --> 1:25:41,493
Padayappa, do you agree?.

823
1:25:42,198 --> 1:25:45,827
If you agree,...

824
1:25:45,901 --> 1:25:49,837
... I have no objection!

825
1:25:50,273 --> 1:25:52,241
I'm very happy.

826
1:26:21,904 --> 1:26:24,031
Are you crying?.

827
1:26:24,573 --> 1:26:26,871
What's your status
and what's my status.

828
1:26:26,942 --> 1:26:32,209
You can only build
castles in the air.

829
1:26:33,249 --> 1:26:36,218
Your wishes can never be fulfilled.

830
1:26:37,253 --> 1:26:42,054
But if I desire something,
I will definitely get it.

831
1:26:43,092 --> 1:26:46,220
Don't let your tears dirty
my nail, keep it clean.

832
1:27:13,122 --> 1:27:15,090
Welcome, welcome.

833
1:27:16,959 --> 1:27:18,256
- Shut up! You please come!
- Welcome!

834
1:27:22,131 --> 1:27:23,928
Why are you standing there?.
Come in.

835
1:27:24,133 --> 1:27:26,101
There isn't enough space
to accommodate all of us.

836
1:27:26,168 --> 1:27:28,261
I think sister has still
not forgotten the past.

837
1:27:28,971 --> 1:27:32,270
No, no, let's exchange the
plates in front of everyone.

838
1:27:32,375 --> 1:27:34,343
Definitely.
Go bring the plate and come.

839
1:27:38,647 --> 1:27:40,615
Come sister,
lets exchange the plates.

840
1:27:40,816 --> 1:27:42,613
I'm a widow, so I can't.

841
1:27:42,985 --> 1:27:45,112
Whatever it is you're
my sister, come.

842
1:27:46,655 --> 1:27:48,623
Give the plate.

843
1:28:05,341 --> 1:28:07,309
I'm willing to get
my son Padayappa...

844
1:28:07,376 --> 1:28:09,640
... married to your
daughter Vasundara.

845
1:28:15,184 --> 1:28:17,652
If you're willing,
please accept this.

846
1:28:20,689 --> 1:28:24,318
Why are you scared?.
No one can do anything to us.

847
1:28:24,693 --> 1:28:27,662
God and my son are
always by our side...

848
1:28:27,730 --> 1:28:30,665
... so, if you're
willing, accept this.

849
1:28:43,379 --> 1:28:45,347
That's a good shot!

850
1:28:45,448 --> 1:28:49,407
You said that it doesn't matter
even if I'm a widow, right?.

851
1:28:50,219 --> 1:28:56,021
I was a widow the other day when
you severed relations with me.

852
1:28:56,725 --> 1:28:58,693
You showed your true
colour that day.

853
1:28:59,228 --> 1:29:01,196
That day I was poor
so you neglected me.

854
1:29:02,064 --> 1:29:08,367
That's why you fell on my leg
yesterday so shamelessly.

855
1:29:10,072 --> 1:29:12,370
Okay, you didn't respect me...

856
1:29:12,741 --> 1:29:15,039
... but do you remember the
promise you gave my husband...

857
1:29:15,110 --> 1:29:20,047
... before this village do you
remember to keep up the promise.

858
1:29:20,749 --> 1:29:22,717
Only if your a human being,
you'll remember all that.

859
1:29:24,487 --> 1:29:27,718
You can ask me, what happened
to the promise that I gave you.

860
1:29:28,424 --> 1:29:31,052
I'm not like you, my family
always keeps up its promises.

861
1:29:31,760 --> 1:29:35,719
My family is a respectable family.

862
1:29:36,265 --> 1:29:39,098
Yesterday I promised to
come to your house...

863
1:29:39,168 --> 1:29:41,728
... but not to fix
up your daughter.

864
1:29:44,106 --> 1:29:46,074
You might have changed our
village's tradition...

865
1:29:46,141 --> 1:29:48,405
... during your son's
marriage but I can't do that.

866
1:29:49,278 --> 1:29:53,237
My husband's words
still echo in my ears.

867
1:29:53,449 --> 1:29:56,077
... that only if the
bride and groom agree,...

868
1:29:56,151 --> 1:29:58,483
... the marriage will take place.

869
1:29:59,121 --> 1:30:02,090
Even though your son
liked my daughter...

870
1:30:02,157 --> 1:30:05,490
... he married another girl
for the sake of money...

871
1:30:06,295 --> 1:30:11,426
... but my son agreed to
marry your daughter,...

872
1:30:11,500 --> 1:30:15,436
... only because I told him.

873
1:30:16,138 --> 1:30:20,097
I can't be a mother if
I can't understand him.

874
1:30:20,809 --> 1:30:23,778
I know who he's in love with.

875
1:30:24,313 --> 1:30:27,146
My son is like a camphor
whether your rich or poor,...

876
1:30:27,216 --> 1:30:29,514
... if you light him,
he'll give you only one light.

877
1:30:30,819 --> 1:30:33,117
How could I afford to hurt
my son's feelings then?.

878
1:30:33,322 --> 1:30:37,122
Padayappa, go bring
my daughter-in-law.

879
1:31:26,375 --> 1:31:29,344
Being a woman,
she boldly spoke to him.

880
1:31:29,878 --> 1:31:34,178
He couldn't reply her
for even one question.

881
1:31:34,550 --> 1:31:36,518
I'd have died of shame!

882
1:31:36,585 --> 1:31:39,349
That day he spoke so much,
now who will marry his daughter.

883
1:31:39,622 --> 1:31:41,180
He gave more importance
to money, didn't he?.

884
1:31:41,390 --> 1:31:44,518
What can money do now,
his respect is gone.

885
1:31:44,893 --> 1:31:47,191
If you can't keep up a
word it's better to die.

886
1:31:47,396 --> 1:31:50,194
Character is very important!

887
1:31:50,265 --> 1:31:52,199
If character is lost
everything is lost.

888
1:31:54,236 --> 1:31:56,204
Oh God!

889
1:31:57,906 --> 1:31:59,874
Father.

890
1:34:10,706 --> 1:34:13,675
Neelambari, what's this?.

891
1:34:14,543 --> 1:34:17,512
Come in.

892
1:34:17,579 --> 1:34:20,343
Are you mad?.
Why are you dancing like this?.

893
1:34:20,716 --> 1:34:23,514
Yes, I'm mad, I'm angry.

894
1:34:23,786 --> 1:34:27,017
I'm angry with that servant.

895
1:34:28,423 --> 1:34:31,688
- I want to own Padayappa.
- What can your anger do now?.

896
1:34:33,061 --> 1:34:40,365
That servant dog even though
she knew that I liked him...

897
1:34:40,469 --> 1:34:44,701
... and still went behind him.

898
1:34:45,407 --> 1:34:51,539
I won't leave her, not only
her but also Padayappa...

899
1:34:51,613 --> 1:34:58,712
... and his mother who were the
cause for our father's death.

900
1:34:59,421 --> 1:35:05,553
I'll avenge this insult!

901
1:35:06,094 --> 1:35:09,552
He's walked away with that girl,
what can you do now?.

902
1:35:10,432 --> 1:35:15,802
This Neelambari can do anything.

903
1:35:17,439 --> 1:35:19,407
All because of me,
I refused to marry his sister,...

904
1:35:19,474 --> 1:35:22,068
... now he has done the same thing.

905
1:35:22,444 --> 1:35:27,074
No, Padayappa loved Vasundara
even before your marriage.

906
1:35:27,449 --> 1:35:29,417
Okay, so what can we do?.

907
1:35:29,618 --> 1:35:31,586
Tell me, shall l
bring him here now?.

908
1:35:32,120 --> 1:35:36,580
Padayappa is a mountain
you can't bring him here.

909
1:35:37,459 --> 1:35:39,427
You can't even touch him!

910
1:35:39,795 --> 1:35:42,093
You don't know when,
where and what to do.

911
1:35:42,798 --> 1:35:45,824
I know how to deal with this matter.

912
1:35:46,468 --> 1:35:50,427
I won't let this
marriage take place.

913
1:35:53,809 --> 1:35:59,111
That day in my desire to own him,
I tied this anklets on my legs.

914
1:36:00,148 --> 1:36:03,606
Today, I tied it
because of my hatred.

915
1:36:04,486 --> 1:36:08,786
Just the way this anklet
deserves to be tied on my feet.

916
1:36:08,857 --> 1:36:12,793
Similarly, Padayappa too
deserves to live on my mercy.

917
1:36:13,662 --> 1:36:18,622
Till I own him, I will not
remove this anklet from my leg.

918
1:36:19,167 --> 1:36:24,867
This is a promise.
This is a promise.

919
1:36:26,508 --> 1:36:28,806
Don't want, why should
you touch my leg.

920
1:36:29,177 --> 1:36:32,476
Vasundara, hereafter your
the master of this house,...

921
1:36:32,547 --> 1:36:35,880
... so we should only
be scared of you.

922
1:36:38,520 --> 1:36:41,819
Brother, wait a minute,
see how your wife is feeling shy.

923
1:36:42,691 --> 1:36:45,660
Before the marriage itself
if she's like this,...

924
1:36:45,727 --> 1:36:48,662
... you'll be able to see
her face only after 3 months.

925
1:36:48,864 --> 1:36:51,662
She'll show her face
but he's only very shy.

926
1:36:51,867 --> 1:36:57,897
Bridegroom, look at her.
Are you feeling shy?.

927
1:36:58,707 --> 1:37:00,675
Look at her!

928
1:37:24,566 --> 1:37:26,864
- Are you fine?.
- I'm fine aunty.

929
1:37:28,570 --> 1:37:30,561
- I came to see Vasundra.
- Go and see.

930
1:37:30,973 --> 1:37:35,706
- Welcome.
- How many months?.

931
1:37:36,912 --> 1:37:38,880
Wait, I'll bring coffee for you.

932
1:37:38,947 --> 1:37:41,882
- Go carefully.
- Sit down.

933
1:37:44,586 --> 1:37:46,554
Please be seated!

934
1:37:46,755 --> 1:37:49,724
Now you're not my servant,
your servant to him alone.

935
1:37:50,592 --> 1:37:52,890
But you're very clever!

936
1:37:53,595 --> 1:37:57,554
Very smartly you hid your feelings.

937
1:37:58,767 --> 1:38:00,735
Please forgive me.

938
1:38:02,270 --> 1:38:06,570
I too loved Padayappa,
but it didn't happen.

939
1:38:07,609 --> 1:38:12,740
Things happen according
to God's will.

940
1:38:14,950 --> 1:38:20,911
Vasundra, now your our girl so
the dowry'll come from our house.

941
1:38:21,289 --> 1:38:26,249
But father has just expired
so I can't do all that.

942
1:38:26,795 --> 1:38:30,595
As a sister I've brought
this saree for you,...

943
1:38:30,665 --> 1:38:33,600
... I've also arranged
for a pooja in your name.

944
1:38:33,802 --> 1:38:35,770
Wear it and go to the temple.

945
1:38:37,672 --> 1:38:39,606
Get up, don't make me feel big.

946
1:38:41,309 --> 1:38:43,777
I'm also a small girl, take this.

947
1:39:06,668 --> 1:39:10,968
Cow! Please help!

948
1:39:11,673 --> 1:39:13,800
Someone please come and help.

949
1:39:14,009 --> 1:39:16,807
Hurry, sister-in-law!

950
1:39:17,679 --> 1:39:20,648
Help!

951
1:45:39,060 --> 1:45:43,190
Is it enough?. It's getting
late quickly tie your saree.

952
1:45:43,264 --> 1:45:45,198
I'll tie it myself,
you people wait outside.

953
1:45:46,067 --> 1:45:49,366
- Why shouldn't we be here?.
- No, no, you wait outside.

954
1:45:52,240 --> 1:45:54,208
Why are standing here?.
Go outside.

955
1:45:59,414 --> 1:46:01,712
I'm sorry for giving
that red saree,...

956
1:46:01,783 --> 1:46:05,219
... I would have spoilt your life.

957
1:46:05,420 --> 1:46:07,388
It's alright!

958
1:46:07,489 --> 1:46:11,391
This is the offering l
made to God on your behalf!

959
1:46:11,459 --> 1:46:13,393
Please have it.

960
1:46:16,264 --> 1:46:18,459
I'll keep it in front of
God and then drink it.

961
1:46:19,267 --> 1:46:22,236
- This is special milk, so make
sure you drink it. - Okay.

962
1:46:24,772 --> 1:46:27,468
Don't forget to come for our marriage,
I need your blessings.

963
1:46:27,775 --> 1:46:29,743
The marriage thats going
to take place is mine,...

964
1:46:29,811 --> 1:46:33,406
... my family's marriage so
without me it can't take place.

965
1:46:34,115 --> 1:46:36,083
I'll definitely be there!

966
1:47:00,808 --> 1:47:06,110
- You look very good. - Me?.
- Not you, sir you turn around.

967
1:47:07,148 --> 1:47:11,448
How did you put your
hand into the snake pit.

968
1:47:11,819 --> 1:47:14,117
Shut up and go that side.

969
1:47:14,489 --> 1:47:16,457
What snake?.
When did you catch?.

970
1:47:17,158 --> 1:47:19,126
Okay, okay, don't get tensed,
the bride will come now.

971
1:47:27,502 --> 1:47:29,470
- Didn't you drink that milk?.
- No!

972
1:47:29,537 --> 1:47:31,129
I kept the milk in front
of God and was praying,...

973
1:47:31,205 --> 1:47:33,139
... the snake came
and spilt the milk.

974
1:47:33,341 --> 1:47:35,138
Only then I remembered
that I've prayed to God...

975
1:47:35,209 --> 1:47:37,541
... that I would pour milk on God.

976
1:47:38,179 --> 1:47:40,147
That's why I went to...

977
1:47:40,214 --> 1:47:42,148
- Hurry, it's getting late.
- Coming, wait a minute.

978
1:47:56,864 --> 1:48:03,167
In the name of Lord Muruga l
ask you, according tell me...

979
1:48:03,237 --> 1:48:08,174
... would you like to marry
this boy wholeheartedly.

980
1:48:09,877 --> 1:48:11,845
Do you also agree wholeheartedly?.

981
1:49:00,428 --> 1:49:02,396
What is this?.

982
1:49:02,463 --> 1:49:04,397
Forget the past!

983
1:49:05,266 --> 1:49:08,394
We brought you to Madras to
forget whatever happened.

984
1:49:09,270 --> 1:49:11,238
Why you are seeing the
same thing again and again?.

985
1:49:12,273 --> 1:49:16,232
Your health will get affected if
you starve, so have some food!

986
1:49:16,944 --> 1:49:18,912
- No.
- Are you Mad?.

987
1:49:19,280 --> 1:49:23,580
Yes! I am Mad, I will not
look at any one of your faces!

988
1:49:24,285 --> 1:49:28,585
I've not only been humiliated
but I've been defeated too.

989
1:49:28,956 --> 1:49:31,254
I've lost to a servant!

990
1:49:31,459 --> 1:49:33,427
I don't know that you
love him this much!

991
1:49:33,494 --> 1:49:35,587
Anyhow, I will bring Him to You!

992
1:49:36,964 --> 1:49:39,262
You want me to be in
the place of a Servant?.

993
1:49:39,333 --> 1:49:41,267
Is it possible for
You to imagine This?.

994
1:49:41,969 --> 1:49:43,937
Are you My Brother?.

995
1:49:44,005 --> 1:49:46,667
- How can you think like this?.
- Neelambari! - Tell Me!

996
1:49:47,475 --> 1:49:49,943
Everything happened
are because of you,...

997
1:49:50,011 --> 1:49:51,945
Because of your money
making intention!

998
1:49:53,314 --> 1:49:57,273
Go!.. Go all of you!
Don't look at my face.

999
1:49:57,485 --> 1:50:01,683
If anyone of you look at my face,
I will burn my face.

1000
1:50:02,490 --> 1:50:06,449
Get out! Get out!
Get out all of you!

1001
1:50:15,503 --> 1:50:17,471
Long live, Suryaprakash!

1002
1:50:18,005 --> 1:50:20,473
Long live, Suryaprakash!

1003
1:50:21,008 --> 1:50:22,976
Long live our leader, Suryaprakash!

1004
1:50:24,011 --> 1:50:26,639
Long live our honourable
minister, Suryaprakash!

1005
1:50:28,516 --> 1:50:30,484
Not for One year, or Two years!

1006
1:50:30,551 --> 1:50:33,714
She kept herself in that
room for eighteen years!

1007
1:50:34,689 --> 1:50:36,657
She has confined
herself to that room.

1008
1:50:37,024 --> 1:50:38,992
She doesn't permit anyone
into the room except me.

1009
1:50:40,361 --> 1:50:43,489
With my growing wealth I have
made many changes to house.

1010
1:50:44,031 --> 1:50:45,658
But I can not change her room alone!

1011
1:50:46,534 --> 1:50:48,502
I can't change her.

1012
1:50:48,569 --> 1:50:50,332
All these are also okay.

1013
1:50:50,404 --> 1:50:52,497
But she didn't come out
for Mother's death too!

1014
1:50:53,040 --> 1:50:56,498
I used to take meals to her room,
that too if she asks!

1015
1:50:57,378 --> 1:50:59,676
If his daughter or any other
person takes meal for her...

1016
1:50:59,747 --> 1:51:01,681
... she will throw the plate away.

1017
1:51:02,717 --> 1:51:05,686
We are not aware of
any of her activities.

1018
1:51:06,387 --> 1:51:09,015
But we can able to here playing
sound of that Marriage cassette.

1019
1:51:09,557 --> 1:51:13,687
- lnspector's here.
- CM is in the Meeting. Can we go?. - Yes!

1020
1:51:14,562 --> 1:51:16,530
Don't forget things
that I told you,...

1021
1:51:16,597 --> 1:51:18,531
You can do any pooja'
at whatever be the cost.

1022
1:51:18,599 --> 1:51:20,533
She should change,
that is important.

1023
1:51:21,068 --> 1:51:23,366
This should not be known to others.

1024
1:51:23,571 --> 1:51:25,539
Uncle CM has begun the
meeting, I'll make a move.

1025
1:51:25,606 --> 1:51:28,700
- The matter that I told you...
- Are you playing?.

1026
1:51:29,076 --> 1:51:32,375
If your sons were held up because
of doing unnecessary Business.

1027
1:51:32,580 --> 1:51:35,549
What can I do?. That too they've
borrowed from Krishnaswamy!

1028
1:51:35,750 --> 1:51:37,718
Son-in-law, everything has gone.

1029
1:51:38,085 --> 1:51:40,713
Only thing left is that house alone.

1030
1:51:40,788 --> 1:51:43,723
If that house is also gone,
then I'll have to stand in the road.

1031
1:51:44,425 --> 1:51:47,053
Please try to get back
atleast the house, son-in-law.

1032
1:51:47,128 --> 1:51:50,564
Think of what all I've done
for you and my daughter.

1033
1:51:51,098 --> 1:51:53,396
What to think of!
He has influence till Delhi.

1034
1:51:53,467 --> 1:51:56,061
If I talk about him to CM,
my post will be in danger.

1035
1:51:56,604 --> 1:51:58,731
- Bye!
- Coffee...

1036
1:51:58,806 --> 1:52:00,740
Give it to Daddy, dear.
Shall I leave.

1037
1:52:01,609 --> 1:52:05,568
- Greetings!
- Make way!

1038
1:52:05,646 --> 1:52:07,739
It's time to go for meeting.
Get in, we'll start.

1039
1:52:39,647 --> 1:52:43,606
Sir, I'll fall on your leg.
Please ask them to stop!

1040
1:52:45,152 --> 1:52:48,781
Daddy, my doll.
I want my doll.

1041
1:52:50,892 --> 1:52:52,860
Some how I'll try to return
your loans sir, please.

1042
1:52:52,927 --> 1:52:54,861
You're keep on telling
that you'll return,...

1043
1:52:54,929 --> 1:52:57,454
... but you are not giving and
I'm not getting, what to do...

1044
1:52:57,565 --> 1:52:59,624
We've been living in this
house for a long time.

1045
1:52:59,700 --> 1:53:01,634
If people come to know of this,
it'll be a big shame for us, sir.

1046
1:53:01,736 --> 1:53:03,465
I know, since it's a old
traditional house,...

1047
1:53:03,537 --> 1:53:05,471
... that's why I gave you money.

1048
1:53:05,673 --> 1:53:07,800
My brother lived with great
dignity in this house.

1049
1:53:07,875 --> 1:53:09,809
Give me some time.
Somehow I'll fill all my loan.

1050
1:53:09,911 --> 1:53:12,471
How! Will you steal!
You might do that also...

1051
1:53:12,546 --> 1:53:15,640
What to do!
The due date is over.

1052
1:53:15,716 --> 1:53:17,479
Now you have no other go.

1053
1:53:17,551 --> 1:53:19,485
Not even God can protect you.

1054
1:53:20,688 --> 1:53:22,656
Who gave it?.

1055
1:53:29,931 --> 1:53:32,491
Hey, stop it.
Take everything inside.

1056
1:53:32,566 --> 1:53:35,501
Madam, please go in.
Couldn't you tell me this before.

1057
1:53:35,703 --> 1:53:37,671
If I have influence all
over the country,...

1058
1:53:37,738 --> 1:53:38,705
... he has it all over the world.

1059
1:53:38,773 --> 1:53:40,673
I have national business,
he has international business.

1060
1:53:40,741 --> 1:53:42,902
He is a mighty influential person!

1061
1:53:43,544 --> 1:53:45,512
You were about to put me in trouble.
Please go in sir.

1062
1:53:45,579 --> 1:53:47,513
Hey, keep everything
in it's place and come.

1063
1:54:33,060 --> 1:54:35,028
Where are you producing trouble?.

1064
1:54:35,396 --> 1:54:37,523
Do you know whose house is this?.

1065
1:54:37,598 --> 1:54:39,532
I know, I heard that you
had problem with them...

1066
1:54:39,600 --> 1:54:41,534
... and so you will not interfere.

1067
1:54:51,812 --> 1:54:54,713
Whatever has to come to
you is here with interest.

1068
1:54:54,782 --> 1:54:57,717
Count and see if it is correct
and bring the documents.

1069
1:54:58,085 --> 1:55:00,713
You give everything
countless we follow you...

1070
1:55:00,788 --> 1:55:02,722
... how can I count your money.

1071
1:55:03,090 --> 1:55:05,058
Hey, bring the documents.

1072
1:55:05,760 --> 1:55:07,728
Oh, I shouted out of habit sorry.

1073
1:55:12,099 --> 1:55:14,397
You go sir, I myself
will arrange everything.

1074
1:55:14,602 --> 1:55:19,733
Hey take everything.
Keep them in their own places.

1075
1:55:22,443 --> 1:55:25,412
There is no history
that a greedy man...

1076
1:55:25,479 --> 1:55:28,414
... and a loud woman
have ever lived happily.

1077
1:55:29,784 --> 1:55:32,412
This is the place where my
father had lived and died.

1078
1:55:32,486 --> 1:55:34,420
For me this is his memorial.

1079
1:55:35,623 --> 1:55:37,591
Atleast from now,
take care of it carefully.

1080
1:55:41,128 --> 1:55:43,096
You have given it already.

1081
1:55:43,164 --> 1:55:45,098
That is to save the house,
this is to save you.

1082
1:55:46,634 --> 1:55:49,603
- Padayappa...
- You are an elder man.

1083
1:55:50,471 --> 1:55:52,439
We're elder only in age.

1084
1:55:52,640 --> 1:55:55,609
But are elder in heart,
so you are a great.

1085
1:55:56,477 --> 1:55:58,604
- Forgive me.
- Forgive us also brother.

1086
1:56:02,149 --> 1:56:04,117
Uncle, remember one thing in life.

1087
1:56:04,819 --> 1:56:06,446
You'll get nothing without hardwork.

1088
1:56:07,154 --> 1:56:10,123
Anything you get without
hardwork will never last.

1089
1:56:40,688 --> 1:56:42,656
Listen.

1090
1:56:47,194 --> 1:56:49,162
Listen.
Please see this.

1091
1:56:51,699 --> 1:56:53,667
Hey, why are you showing hand?..

1092
1:56:53,734 --> 1:56:55,668
If you show hand,
we'll be terrified?.

1093
1:56:55,736 --> 1:56:57,670
Give it, we'll accept it!

1094
1:57:00,708 --> 1:57:04,838
Hey, our children.
It was you.

1095
1:57:07,548 --> 1:57:11,177
Enough...enough...enough.
Enough of studying in Madras.

1096
1:57:11,252 --> 1:57:14,187
Hereafter learn to do
the household chores.

1097
1:57:14,889 --> 1:57:18,188
Daddy, see daddy.
Only 2 years course. Tell her.

1098
1:57:20,561 --> 1:57:22,529
What?.
You have influence only outside.

1099
1:57:22,596 --> 1:57:24,530
House is under mother's control?.

1100
1:57:24,632 --> 1:57:26,532
Mummy, sister likes to learn.

1101
1:57:26,600 --> 1:57:28,534
If you had a boy you would
let him to learn isn't it!

1102
1:57:28,736 --> 1:57:32,866
All you need is an assistant, isn't it?.
I'll stop studying.

1103
1:57:33,574 --> 1:57:35,542
You can act well though
you can't study.

1104
1:57:35,743 --> 1:57:37,711
Correct, like your mother.

1105
1:57:45,753 --> 1:57:47,721
What yes..yes...yes... Tell there.

1106
1:57:52,760 --> 1:57:54,728
It's a matter of 2 years, after all.

1107
1:57:56,263 --> 1:57:58,231
Daddy... Please.

1108
1:58:05,940 --> 1:58:10,570
Vasu...Vasu... Let her study further.

1109
1:58:10,778 --> 1:58:12,746
Ok, let her study.

1110
1:58:16,283 --> 1:58:18,581
They are my friends.
They've come for my birthday.

1111
1:58:18,786 --> 1:58:20,754
- Greetings!
- He's my Dad.

1112
1:58:26,794 --> 1:58:28,762
What do they say?.

1113
1:59:16,010 --> 1:59:18,808
I'm a worldwide fraud.
You show me your fraud.

1114
1:59:18,879 --> 1:59:20,642
You mixed brandy, isn't?.

1115
1:59:20,748 --> 1:59:22,807
You and your sons drink illicit liquor.
Do I drink it.

1116
1:59:23,684 --> 1:59:25,652
We drank once upon a time.
Now we've changed know!

1117
1:59:25,753 --> 1:59:27,812
What change... See
here... brandy bottle.

1118
1:59:28,355 --> 1:59:30,823
If Padayappa comes to know of this,..
- He will kill you.

1119
1:59:30,891 --> 1:59:33,052
How will he know when I've
mixed it with cool drinks?.

1120
1:59:33,694 --> 1:59:35,662
- lt'll smell. - I'll put betelnuts.
- I'll tell him.

1121
1:59:35,729 --> 1:59:37,321
I'll tell him that you
bought me betelnuts.

1122
1:59:38,032 --> 1:59:40,660
Who am l?.
Alagapuri Alagesan.

1123
1:59:40,868 --> 1:59:42,995
Then mixed it with colour,
you'll never know it.

1124
1:59:43,070 --> 1:59:45,004
You'll never know it.

1125
1:59:45,105 --> 1:59:47,005
Like monkey spoiling
itself and others,...

1126
1:59:47,074 --> 1:59:48,666
... you are spoiling others also.

1127
1:59:48,776 --> 1:59:50,676
- What I'm spoiling others?.
- Yes. - See there!

1128
2:00:05,392 --> 2:00:09,351

1139
2:00:48,135 --> 2:00:53,129
Longlive... Ionglive...

1140
2:00:55,442 --> 2:00:57,410
Longlive...Ionglive...
You sit sir.

1141
2:00:57,778 --> 2:00:59,746
Hey...go apart.
Always shouting.

1142
2:01:00,447 --> 2:01:03,416
Hey tell him about me.
My early days friend.

1143
2:01:03,484 --> 2:01:05,748
Name Rajbagadur.
You can call him anyway.

1144
2:01:05,953 --> 2:01:08,751
I told him not to join politics.
He didn't listen.

1145
2:01:08,956 --> 2:01:10,924
Did you listen to me?.
He refuses to join politics.

1146
2:01:11,125 --> 2:01:13,093
Why, you don't want me to be fine?.

1147
2:01:13,160 --> 2:01:15,094
Why you alone should be fine?.
People also should be fine no.

1148
2:01:15,796 --> 2:01:17,923
Yes. You are correct.
But one thing.

1149
2:01:17,998 --> 2:01:19,932
If he comes with you,
you might change him.

1150
2:01:20,467 --> 2:01:22,435
Is he going to change?.
He'll change all of us.

1151
2:01:22,970 --> 2:01:24,938
That is also correct.

1152
2:01:25,005 --> 2:01:27,439
You win in everything.
Why don't you try this also.

1153
2:01:27,808 --> 2:01:29,776
What is there in our hands,
Mr. Ravi. Everything.

1154
2:01:30,811 --> 2:01:32,779
- Always lift your hand up.
- Shall we start the party?.

1155
2:01:33,814 --> 2:01:35,782
- I should get the seat first.
- Calm down!

1156
2:01:37,217 --> 2:01:41,119
Be seated.
I told to start the birthday party.

1157
2:01:41,989 --> 2:01:44,116
Anyway, you have to start a party.

1158
2:01:44,491 --> 2:01:46,789
Are you going to Himalayas?.
Will we leave you?.

1159
2:01:46,994 --> 2:01:49,121
Hey, what are you doing here?.

1160
2:01:49,496 --> 2:01:51,964
- We were drinking cool drinks.
- What cool drinks?.

1161
2:01:52,032 --> 2:01:53,966
Nobody is there to welcome
guests, you're busy drinking?.

1162
2:01:54,034 --> 2:01:55,968
Give it and go.

1163
2:01:56,170 --> 2:01:57,797
What noise?.

1164
2:01:57,871 --> 2:01:59,964
Nothing.
Padayappa drank the cool drinks.

1165
2:02:00,841 --> 2:02:03,207
What...what... Haven't l
drunk cool drinks before.

1166
2:02:03,510 --> 2:02:05,478
Give it.

1167
2:02:05,846 --> 2:02:08,815
- It's two now.
- What two.

1168
2:02:08,882 --> 2:02:11,817
I'll drink four, forty.
What bothers you?. Give it.

1169
2:02:23,197 --> 2:02:25,165
What happened?.
It's nice.

1170
2:02:25,532 --> 2:02:28,000
Brother, come here.
It's getting late to cut the cake.

1171
2:02:29,036 --> 2:02:33,166
- I'm coming. Go. It's nice,
keep it for me. - I will!

1172
2:02:40,881 --> 2:02:44,180
No, mother first,
all next including God.

1173
2:02:44,885 --> 2:02:46,853
Yes.

1174
2:08:16,383 --> 2:08:18,351
It's eighteen years.

1175
2:08:18,418 --> 2:08:20,352
Still you think of him and make
your life miserable like a mad.

1176
2:08:20,554 --> 2:08:23,523
But he.
He is happy, very very happy.

1177
2:08:23,890 --> 2:08:25,858
See this, see this well.

1178
2:08:25,926 --> 2:08:28,861
He, his wife, his two
daughters are enjoying life.

1179
2:08:29,229 --> 2:08:32,528
But you! Day and night you sit
in the same room like a devil...

1180
2:08:32,599 --> 2:08:34,533
... sleeplessly thinking
of him get destroyed.

1181
2:08:35,902 --> 2:08:39,360
I've never seen, heard or learned
in history about a girl like you.

1182
2:08:40,407 --> 2:08:44,605
Enough. enough.
Atleast hereafter try to be happy.

1183
2:08:46,646 --> 2:08:48,204
Even I tried to ruin
him in many ways.

1184
2:08:48,281 --> 2:08:51,216
Using my political influence
I tried to make the...

1185
2:08:51,284 --> 2:08:53,218
...government take over
his granite factory.

1186
2:08:53,920 --> 2:08:56,548
I couldn't. He is brilliant.
Nothing is there in his name.

1187
2:08:57,424 --> 2:08:59,392
He has everything in the
name of his village people.

1188
2:09:00,260 --> 2:09:02,228
If police enters, the
whole village is opposing.

1189
2:09:02,295 --> 2:09:04,229
Government is nothing in
front of people's power.

1190
2:09:04,431 --> 2:09:07,889
We can never ruin him.
Forget everything.

1191
2:09:08,935 --> 2:09:13,235
Opposing him is useless.
We can't take revenge on him.

1192
2:09:18,445 --> 2:09:20,413
For how many days will you
keep on seeing his marriage.

1193
2:09:20,480 --> 2:09:22,414
He himself has daughters
ready for marriage.

1194
2:09:22,482 --> 2:09:24,416
His daughter is studying with
my son in the same college.

1195
2:09:46,306 --> 2:09:48,274
What are you looking at?.

1196
2:09:48,475 --> 2:09:50,443
After eighteen years I've
got another chance...

1197
2:09:50,510 --> 2:09:56,278
... to take revenge on Padayappa.

1198
2:10:23,343 --> 2:10:25,311
- Where is the dressing room?.
- There.

1199
2:10:48,535 --> 2:10:51,333
Call your son.
Hey, Chandru.

1200
2:10:55,375 --> 2:10:57,343
What Daddy?.

1201
2:10:58,044 --> 2:11:00,740
Wow aunty, you are super.

1202
2:11:01,381 --> 2:11:04,350
When I was small I used to peep
through the door with fear.

1203
2:11:04,417 --> 2:11:06,749
- But now... - Do you know to drive?.
- He is an expert.

1204
2:11:08,054 --> 2:11:11,683
- But we have many drivers.
- Let him drive.

1205
2:11:12,392 --> 2:11:14,360
You too come with us.

1206
2:11:43,590 --> 2:11:45,717
That girl in violet is Anitha.
Padayappa uncle's daughter.

1207
2:11:57,437 --> 2:11:59,405
Hereafter she shouldn't smile.

1208
2:11:59,472 --> 2:12:02,407
That servant's daughter
should not be happy.

1209
2:12:03,443 --> 2:12:05,570
Padayappa's loving
daughter should cry.

1210
2:12:07,447 --> 2:12:09,574
Your son should love that girl.

1211
2:12:10,450 --> 2:12:12,418
She should also love your son.

1212
2:12:12,485 --> 2:12:14,817
Should act as if he is in love.
Understood?.

1213
2:12:15,622 --> 2:12:18,420
Don't worry. My son will
act according to your wish.

1214
2:12:18,625 --> 2:12:20,752
He knows that you are
very dear to me.

1215
2:12:21,795 --> 2:12:25,754
If he doesn't do it, I will
strangle his neck and kill him.

1216
2:12:26,132 --> 2:12:28,760
Why are staring?.
Do what I say. Start!

1217
2:12:30,136 --> 2:12:34,766
- How, how... how?.
- Hey, No Chandru don't.

1218
2:13:23,189 --> 2:13:25,157
Why do you cry now?.

1219
2:13:25,225 --> 2:13:27,159
Have I come to seperate
you and Chandru?.

1220
2:13:27,527 --> 2:13:29,552
I've come to unite you two.
Don't worry.

1221
2:13:29,696 --> 2:13:31,823
You and my brother's son
will definitely marry.

1222
2:13:32,532 --> 2:13:34,500
Even your father can't stop it.

1223
2:13:34,701 --> 2:13:36,828
No aunty.
You don't know about my dad.

1224
2:13:37,704 --> 2:13:39,672
I don't know?.
What do you know?.

1225
2:13:39,739 --> 2:13:41,673
I heard that you were not
in town for eighteen years.

1226
2:13:41,741 --> 2:13:43,504
If you were here, we would've
been like family friends.

1227
2:13:43,576 --> 2:13:45,510
his marriage would have been easier.

1228
2:13:45,612 --> 2:13:47,671
What happened now?.
Everything will be easy.

1229
2:13:47,747 --> 2:13:49,681
This time, what I think
should definitely happen.

1230
2:13:49,883 --> 2:13:51,851
- Madam, you've got a phone call.
- I'll talk and come.

1231
2:13:53,553 --> 2:13:55,851
- Still daughter is not on line?.
- They've gone to call her.

1232
2:13:55,955 --> 2:13:57,513
Brother, will Anitha accept?.

1233
2:13:57,590 --> 2:13:59,524
Why do you worry?.
She's my daughter.

1234
2:14:00,727 --> 2:14:02,695
I am your dad speaking.
Hello dad.

1235
2:14:03,229 --> 2:14:06,198
Daddy. How are you...
I'm fine dear, how are you?.

1236
2:14:08,568 --> 2:14:10,536
It's too many days since I saw you.

1237
2:14:11,571 --> 2:14:13,539
I want to see you immediately.

1238
2:14:14,240 --> 2:14:18,870
I wish to see you married soon!

1239
2:14:18,945 --> 2:14:20,708
No no, your mother wishes.

1240
2:14:20,914 --> 2:14:22,939
- Lie...
- No...your father is willing.

1241
2:14:23,249 --> 2:14:26,218
Murugesa... beat him you
know who is the groom...

1242
2:14:26,286 --> 2:14:28,220
... none other then
my sister's son.

1243
2:14:28,288 --> 2:14:30,222
We all wish that you
two should get married.

1244
2:14:30,990 --> 2:14:32,548
But according to
our village customs,...

1245
2:14:32,625 --> 2:14:34,559
... the bride and the groom
should like each other.

1246
2:14:34,627 --> 2:14:36,561
That's why I asked your wish.
What do you say?.

1247
2:14:37,597 --> 2:14:39,565
What are you thinking of?.

1248
2:14:39,632 --> 2:14:40,724
Because the boy is not educated?.
You have studied no...

1249
2:14:40,934 --> 2:14:42,902
Both should not be educated.
If so, there will be confusion.

1250
2:14:43,770 --> 2:14:45,897
Now see I and your
mother are so happy.

1251
2:14:46,606 --> 2:14:48,574
Why, I'm educated.
But she is not. That's why.

1252
2:14:50,276 --> 2:14:52,972
Shall we have the
marriage after your exams?.

1253
2:14:53,613 --> 2:14:55,581
- Now say yes to your dad.
- Why?.

1254
2:14:55,782 --> 2:14:57,579
Has the line been cut?.

1255
2:14:57,650 --> 2:14:59,584
- No. The lights are on.
- It is a phone, not current.

1256
2:14:59,686 --> 2:15:01,654
I'll explain everything later.
First say yes.

1257
2:15:01,955 --> 2:15:04,753
- Yes dad.
- Give your hand.

1258
2:15:05,625 --> 2:15:07,593
So shall I start the
arrangements for the marriage.

1259
2:15:07,961 --> 2:15:10,259
- Marriage. - Tell him that
everything is as per his wish.

1260
2:15:10,630 --> 2:15:16,262
- How... Tell what I say...
- Okay dad, as you wish.

1261
2:15:16,469 --> 2:15:18,596
Wow... my darling...

1262
2:15:23,643 --> 2:15:25,770
She's my daughter after all!

1263
2:15:25,979 --> 2:15:28,777
What son-in-law, are you happy?.

1264
2:15:28,982 --> 2:15:31,007
See how I'm going to
make the wedding grand.

1265
2:15:31,317 --> 2:15:34,616
Hey Alagesa, Murugesa,
Hang garlands on every street,...

1266
2:15:34,687 --> 2:15:36,621
... house and doors.

1267
2:15:36,823 --> 2:15:38,950
None of our ancestors should have
ever conducted such a marriage.

1268
2:15:39,058 --> 2:15:41,618
I will conduct such
a grand marriage.

1269
2:15:42,996 --> 2:15:44,964
Do you want to possess
Chandru whom you love most...

1270
2:15:45,031 --> 2:15:46,965
... and wish to get
married grandly...

1271
2:15:47,033 --> 2:15:49,627
...in the presence of your
parents in your village?.

1272
2:15:50,837 --> 2:15:52,964
Then listen to me.

1273
2:16:07,854 --> 2:16:09,822
In the name of Lord
Muruga I ask you,...

1274
2:16:09,889 --> 2:16:11,823
... according your
self-conscious,...

1275
2:16:11,891 --> 2:16:13,825
... and on the promise
of Aarupadayyapan's...

1276
2:16:13,893 --> 2:16:17,056
...tell me would you like to
marry this girl wholeheartedly.

1277
2:16:18,364 --> 2:16:20,662
Yes Uncle.
Yes Sir.

1278
2:16:22,035 --> 2:16:24,003
In the name of the Lord,...

1279
2:16:24,070 --> 2:16:29,667
... do you also agree to
marry this boy wholeheartedly?.

1280
2:16:34,714 --> 2:16:36,682
- Tell me.
- I don't agree, sir.

1281
2:16:42,388 --> 2:16:46,848
Why no?.
Didn't they seek your consent.

1282
2:16:47,126 --> 2:16:50,027
That day's situation made me accept.

1283
2:16:51,397 --> 2:16:53,365
Why you didn't like this groom?.

1284
2:16:54,400 --> 2:17:00,032
I'm in love with another boy.
I like to marry him.

1285
2:17:01,741 --> 2:17:08,044
Okay, is that boy present
in this crowd?. Tell.

1286
2:17:15,421 --> 2:17:17,719
Madam! Tell me if you
want only this girl...

1287
2:17:17,790 --> 2:17:20,054
... to be your daughter-in-law?.

1288
2:17:20,760 --> 2:17:22,728
Nothing like that, brother.

1289
2:17:22,795 --> 2:17:25,127
I want my son to
become your son-in-law.

1290
2:17:25,932 --> 2:17:27,900
Take the garland from
your shoulders...

1291
2:17:27,967 --> 2:17:29,901
... and put it on your
sister's shoulders.

1292
2:17:30,770 --> 2:17:32,738
Do as I say!

1293
2:17:34,941 --> 2:17:39,742
- Do you consent to marry this girl?.
- Yes sir.

1294
2:17:41,114 --> 2:17:47,917
You... Don't be afraid of anybody.
Tell me what you feel.

1295
2:17:48,121 --> 2:17:54,151
I like the groom.
But I don't like to marry now.

1296
2:17:55,962 --> 2:17:57,930
What do you say?.

1297
2:17:57,997 --> 2:18:01,160
I don't want to get married
before my sister's marriage.

1298
2:18:01,801 --> 2:18:07,762
If we marry on the same
day also no problem.

1299
2:18:07,840 --> 2:18:14,769
But if it happens before her,
it might affect her marriage.

1300
2:18:17,483 --> 2:18:19,451
Please tell your decision.

1301
2:18:19,819 --> 2:18:23,118
I can't change the
traditional rituals.

1302
2:18:23,489 --> 2:18:25,957
Every marriage that takes place
in this village should be...

1303
2:18:26,025 --> 2:18:27,959
...according to the
wish of the bride...

1304
2:18:28,027 --> 2:18:29,961
... and the groom
than their parents.

1305
2:18:30,029 --> 2:18:32,122
No unwilling should take
place in this village.

1306
2:18:32,498 --> 2:18:35,467
Such a marriage will not
be conducted by my family.

1307
2:18:37,837 --> 2:18:39,805
Open that well!

1308
2:18:41,007 --> 2:18:42,975
From the time he
started conducting...

1309
2:18:43,042 --> 2:18:45,806
... the village's marriage the
well was not at all opened.

1310
2:18:46,012 --> 2:18:49,470
Today because of his daughters,
the well has to be opened.

1311
2:19:15,875 --> 2:19:18,002
You know the rules of this village.

1312
2:19:18,544 --> 2:19:22,503
Marry your girl to whom she loves.

1313
2:19:23,049 --> 2:19:26,018
If you get her married
to somebody else,...

1314
2:19:26,085 --> 2:19:28,019
... your family cannot
live in this village.

1315
2:19:31,891 --> 2:19:34,018
I won't take it as a shame
for whatever happened here.

1316
2:19:35,561 --> 2:19:38,029
I take it as a chance to
know my two daughter's mind.

1317
2:19:38,898 --> 2:19:41,526
Now I tell in front
of all of you,...

1318
2:19:41,601 --> 2:19:46,197
I'll conduct the marriage of my
elder daughter with the boy...

1319
2:19:46,272 --> 2:19:48,536
...she likes, here, in
the next auspicious day.

1320
2:19:49,075 --> 2:19:50,042
On the same day my
second daughter...

1321
2:19:50,109 --> 2:19:53,875
... will get married
to my sister's son.

1322
2:19:54,080 --> 2:19:56,048
If it does not happen,...

1323
2:19:56,115 --> 2:20:00,051
... it means that Padayappa's
breath has stopped.

1324
2:20:00,920 --> 2:20:02,888
I swear on Lord Muruga!

1325
2:20:16,936 --> 2:20:19,234
Tell me. Open your mouth and answer.

1326
2:20:19,605 --> 2:20:22,233
Why did you do this?.
I don't oppose your affair.

1327
2:20:22,942 --> 2:20:25,240
But why didn't you
tell when we asked?.

1328
2:20:25,945 --> 2:20:28,243
Do you know how much
shame you brought to him.

1329
2:20:28,614 --> 2:20:30,582
I'm asking you,
why don't you answer?.

1330
2:20:31,350 --> 2:20:34,581
No mummy. They told me not to
tell the truth till the end.

1331
2:20:34,954 --> 2:20:36,922
Who said so?.

1332
2:20:45,965 --> 2:20:47,933
What Neelambari has to
do with your marriage?.

1333
2:20:48,134 --> 2:20:50,602
I love her brother's son.

1334
2:20:53,306 --> 2:20:55,274
Why didn't you tell this before?.

1335
2:20:55,641 --> 2:20:58,610
If I tell this, daddy will
not accept for the marriage.

1336
2:20:59,145 --> 2:21:01,113
If I tell my wish infront
of the villagers,...

1337
2:21:01,180 --> 2:21:03,114
... in the temple of
Aarupadayappa,...

1338
2:21:03,182 --> 2:21:09,121
... nobody can stop but.get me
married to the person you love.

1339
2:21:09,188 --> 2:21:11,281
Neelambari aunty said this.

1340
2:21:12,658 --> 2:21:15,627
She told me she'll come with her
brother's son for marriage,...

1341
2:21:15,695 --> 2:21:17,629
... but never turned up.

1342
2:21:18,998 --> 2:21:23,128
- Come here!
- Go, he is calling you.

1343
2:21:37,183 --> 2:21:39,151
- What is his name?.
- Chandru.

1344
2:21:39,352 --> 2:21:41,320
- How did you get introduced?.
- We study in the same college.

1345
2:21:42,188 --> 2:21:44,315
- Does he love you?.
- Yes dad.

1346
2:21:45,024 --> 2:21:47,322
- How do you know?.
- I'm your daughter.

1347
2:21:48,027 --> 2:21:51,326
I'll never get fooled.
Forgive me dad.

1348
2:21:54,033 --> 2:21:56,160
When you start to love,
you forget your parents.

1349
2:21:56,435 --> 2:21:58,403
When you love,
you forget yourself.

1350
2:21:58,704 --> 2:22:01,172
Don't forget love after marriage.

1351
2:22:04,043 --> 2:22:06,011
Children might forget
their parents...

1352
2:22:06,078 --> 2:22:08,012
... but parents will never
forget their children.

1353
2:22:09,048 --> 2:22:11,016
Take the car.

1354
2:22:15,054 --> 2:22:19,013
You don't go there.
Please listen to me..

1355
2:22:21,060 --> 2:22:24,359
No, listen please...

1356
2:22:38,744 --> 2:22:41,372
- Madam, Padayappa has come.
- Who?.

1357
2:22:42,081 --> 2:22:44,208
That is our great Padayappa.

1358
2:22:44,283 --> 2:22:47,719
You know how he looks at this
age also like Margandeyan.

1359
2:22:49,088 --> 2:22:51,056
Ok mam.
Yes mam.

1360
2:22:51,257 --> 2:22:53,225
- Ask him to come inside.
- Alright.

1361
2:23:00,099 --> 2:23:02,067
Please come in!

1362
2:23:05,104 --> 2:23:07,072
One minute please.

1363
2:23:07,173 --> 2:23:10,233
Didn't the snake bite when you
put your hand into the pit.

1364
2:23:11,277 --> 2:23:14,075
- Yes, it bit. - It bit?.
Then poison would got in.

1365
2:23:14,280 --> 2:23:17,078
No snake poison would
get into this body.

1366
2:23:18,284 --> 2:23:20,411
Big snake is going to come.
Be careful.

1367
2:25:11,897 --> 2:25:16,857
Electrifying man, you know
why everybody likes you...

1368
2:25:16,936 --> 2:25:21,873
... though aged, your style
and beauty has not gone.

1369
2:25:22,241 --> 2:25:26,871
Thank you thank you... It's
born with me, never goes out.

1370
2:25:27,413 --> 2:25:30,211
How is she, the servant of my house?.

1371
2:25:30,416 --> 2:25:34,375
Sorry, the madam of my house.
Very very fine.

1372
2:25:35,588 --> 2:25:38,614
- Why did you come to see me?.
- I didn't come to see you.

1373
2:25:38,691 --> 2:25:41,626
I came to see my
would-be son-in-law.

1374
2:25:42,261 --> 2:25:44,229
- Your son-in-law?.
- Yes.

1375
2:25:44,430 --> 2:25:47,399
My daughter loved him.
He also loved her.

1376
2:25:47,933 --> 2:25:49,901
Chandru loves your daughter?.

1377
2:25:50,269 --> 2:25:52,396
Who asked you to come in?.
Security, what are you doing?.

1378
2:25:52,471 --> 2:25:54,405
Why did you make him to sit?.

1379
2:25:54,607 --> 2:25:57,235
Why are you shouting?.
Call your son.

1380
2:25:57,943 --> 2:25:59,911
He wants to talk to him.

1381
2:26:00,112 --> 2:26:02,080
Why, what does he want
to talk to my son?.

1382
2:26:02,281 --> 2:26:06,650
- Call him. - How are you?.
- I'm fine brother.

1383
2:26:14,293 --> 2:26:16,261
Dad, did you call me?.

1384
2:26:18,297 --> 2:26:21,664
Your uncle has come to talk to you.

1385
2:26:22,301 --> 2:26:24,667
Uncle?. Suppose he'd married
you I can call him uncle...

1386
2:26:24,737 --> 2:26:26,671
... because he's my aunt's husband.

1387
2:26:27,306 --> 2:26:30,275
- Now why... uncle.
- You didn't understand.

1388
2:26:30,476 --> 2:26:32,603
He wants to get you
married to his daughter...

1389
2:26:32,678 --> 2:26:34,612
... and become your father-in-law.

1390
2:26:34,713 --> 2:26:36,613
His daughter is not
lucky enough for that.

1391
2:26:37,983 --> 2:26:42,283
He only told that you and his
daughter love each other.

1392
2:26:42,488 --> 2:26:45,457
Many girls love me in college.
But I should love them, isn't it?.

1393
2:26:46,492 --> 2:26:49,689
If his daughter loves me,
ask her to come. I'll keep her.

1394
2:26:50,996 --> 2:26:52,964
As a servant.

1395
2:27:05,678 --> 2:27:08,306
Marriage invitation.
It's for you. Take it.

1396
2:27:10,015 --> 2:27:11,983
You know who's getting married?.

1397
2:27:12,051 --> 2:27:15,316
It's between my do
you know Umanath,...

1398
2:27:15,387 --> 2:27:18,720
... a hundred times richer
than you, his daughter.

1399
2:27:19,692 --> 2:27:21,990
Don't definitely come for marriage.

1400
2:27:22,695 --> 2:27:24,993
It's a minister's home wedding.
They won't let you in.

1401
2:27:25,531 --> 2:27:27,499
You know the date of marriage?.

1402
2:27:27,566 --> 2:27:29,500
Remember your promise in
front of all the villagers,'

1403
2:27:29,568 --> 2:27:31,502
' In the next auspicious date...

1404
2:27:31,570 --> 2:27:33,504
... I'll conduct the
marriage of my two daughters.

1405
2:27:33,572 --> 2:27:35,506
If it does not happen,
it means that Padayappa's...

1406
2:27:35,574 --> 2:27:38,737
... breath has stopped'.
That same day,

1407
2:27:44,383 --> 2:27:47,682
Remember, when you
stopped my marriage.

1408
2:27:47,753 --> 2:27:52,690
My dad also bowed his head like
this, thinking of his daughter.

1409
2:27:54,727 --> 2:27:56,695
As my father hanged himself...

1410
2:27:56,762 --> 2:27:59,697
... when he could not
keep up his promise,...

1411
2:28:00,733 --> 2:28:05,693
... you should also hang
yourself in shame...

1412
2:28:05,771 --> 2:28:08,706
... in front of the villagers.

1413
2:28:10,075 --> 2:28:12,373
Seeing that, I should feel happy.

1414
2:28:13,412 --> 2:28:16,381
Only then, my father's
soul will rest in peace.

1415
2:28:18,417 --> 2:28:22,376
As I suffered for not
getting the one I loved,...

1416
2:28:23,422 --> 2:28:30,385
Similarly, your daughter too
should suffer all her life.

1417
2:28:31,430 --> 2:28:38,393
My servant who is your
wife now, should cry...

1418
2:28:38,470 --> 2:28:43,066
... over her daughter's
plight, all her life.

1419
2:28:44,443 --> 2:28:48,812
That's the pleasure
Neelambari will derive...

1420
2:28:48,881 --> 2:28:52,817
... after 1 8 years of
self-imposed exile.

1421
2:28:56,121 --> 2:29:02,082
You boast that your path
is unique, don't you?.

1422
2:29:02,161 --> 2:29:05,096
My path too is unique!

1423
2:29:06,131 --> 2:29:09,430
You can't outsmart me, anymore!

1424
2:29:10,135 --> 2:29:12,763
Bravo! That was a
master plan indeed.

1425
2:29:13,138 --> 2:29:17,097
You'll be a very
successful politician.

1426
2:29:25,150 --> 2:29:28,119
This is the first time
it has slipped, isn't it?.

1427
2:29:30,823 --> 2:29:33,792
I change towels often
but I don't lose them.

1428
2:29:35,160 --> 2:29:37,128
You keep it safely too!

1429
2:29:38,163 --> 2:29:40,791
Do you think I've
forgotten the past?.

1430
2:29:41,500 --> 2:29:43,627
A politician may fail
to keep promises...

1431
2:29:43,702 --> 2:29:45,863
... but he will never
fail to avenge his insult.

1432
2:29:47,172 --> 2:29:50,471
Open the door,
Padayappa is leaving.

1433
2:30:25,878 --> 2:30:32,841
I'm your daughter,
I surely won't get cheated.

1434
2:30:33,552 --> 2:30:35,679
Why haven't you returned yet?.
What took you so long?.

1435
2:30:35,754 --> 2:30:37,688
Did you call for us urgently?.
What's the matter?.

1436
2:30:41,894 --> 2:30:44,863
Ask Vasundara to make
arrangements for the marriage.

1437
2:30:44,963 --> 2:30:46,931
Are you sure?.

1438
2:30:47,232 --> 2:30:50,861
- Don't you know my nature?.
- But everything is in their favour.

1439
2:30:53,572 --> 2:30:56,700
But God is in our favour!

1440
2:31:17,930 --> 2:31:19,898
Padayappa and his men may
come in disguise, be careful.

1441
2:31:20,265 --> 2:31:22,233
Don't worry, I'll take care!

1442
2:31:24,770 --> 2:31:26,897
Did you check the kitchen?.
Are they keeping a watching?.

1443
2:31:27,606 --> 2:31:29,574
Are the Mufty cops indoors?.

1444
2:32:25,998 --> 2:32:27,966
Padayappa has arrived!

1445
2:32:58,030 --> 2:32:59,998
You aren't permitted to go inside.

1446
2:33:01,700 --> 2:33:04,328
- Why?.
- Do you have an invitation?.

1447
2:33:04,870 --> 2:33:07,668
That's irrelevant!
Drive him away!

1448
2:33:07,873 --> 2:33:11,001
- He's uninvited!
- That's right!

1449
2:33:11,376 --> 2:33:13,344
In fact I've come to invite!

1450
2:33:13,545 --> 2:33:15,513
- Whom?.
- Son-in-law!

1451
2:33:16,381 --> 2:33:18,349
My son-in-law!

1452
2:33:18,717 --> 2:33:20,685
But why do you want to take him?.

1453
2:33:20,752 --> 2:33:22,344
Because this marriage
is against his wishes.

1454
2:33:22,721 --> 2:33:24,848
- Who said so?.
- The groom himself said so.

1455
2:33:25,057 --> 2:33:30,689
- My son!?. - Yes, Honourable
Minister's only son.

1456
2:33:31,730 --> 2:33:33,857
Why are you silent?.
Speak up!

1457
2:33:35,400 --> 2:33:39,029
- I'll tell you.
- Hey! Who are you?.

1458
2:33:39,738 --> 2:33:42,036
Why have you abducted me?.
Don't you know who I am?.

1459
2:33:42,908 --> 2:33:47,106
We know you, but you should know
of one man who's very popular.

1460
2:33:47,913 --> 2:33:49,881
Look there!

1461
2:33:55,921 --> 2:33:57,889
Are you trying to threaten me?.

1462
2:33:58,423 --> 2:34:00,891
- My father has many henchmen.
- They aren't henchmen.

1463
2:34:01,426 --> 2:34:03,394
They are my friends!

1464
2:34:03,595 --> 2:34:07,725
I too have a gang of
men who obey my orders.

1465
2:34:07,799 --> 2:34:12,395
Your father's henchmen are cowards.
But my men are brave.

1466
2:34:12,771 --> 2:34:15,740
But I've never misused their
services for my selfish motive.

1467
2:34:16,775 --> 2:34:20,074
I'm good to those who are good to me.
And you too are good.

1468
2:34:20,445 --> 2:34:22,413
I know that.
Tell me the truth.

1469
2:34:22,481 --> 2:34:24,415
- Weren't you involved with my daughter?.
- No!

1470
2:34:24,516 --> 2:34:27,076
- Didn't you love her?.
- No!

1471
2:34:27,185 --> 2:34:29,153
- Didn't you promise to marry her?.
- No!

1472
2:34:29,788 --> 2:34:32,086
- Didn't you love her?.
- No! Not at all!

1473
2:34:32,457 --> 2:34:34,425
Your daughter isn't worthy of me.

1474
2:34:37,963 --> 2:34:40,932
Why have you stopped?.
Face her boldly...

1475
2:34:40,999 --> 2:34:43,934
... and repeat what
you just told me.

1476
2:35:04,222 --> 2:35:06,190
Pardon me, uncle!

1477
2:35:06,825 --> 2:35:10,192
They asked me to pretend to love
Anitha, but I loved her truly.

1478
2:35:10,829 --> 2:35:14,196
If my father and Neelambari
know of this, they'll kill me.

1479
2:35:15,500 --> 2:35:17,468
You should help us unite!

1480
2:35:21,840 --> 2:35:23,808
It slips only once!

1481
2:35:27,179 --> 2:35:29,204
Father!

1482
2:35:37,522 --> 2:35:39,490
Finally you joined
him to stage a drama.

1483
2:35:40,025 --> 2:35:42,994
No. One hit, not even one hit
should fall on my son-in-law.

1484
2:35:44,529 --> 2:35:47,157
Mr.Suryaprakash,
care for your son's life.

1485
2:35:47,866 --> 2:35:49,993
Don't listen to others to
make his life miserable.

1486
2:35:50,202 --> 2:35:53,000
You are in a responsible post.
Don't misuse it.

1487
2:35:53,538 --> 2:35:55,506
Don't spoil the name of your party.

1488
2:35:55,874 --> 2:35:59,002
Enough of your advice.
He is my son. I'll compel him to marry.

1489
2:35:59,211 --> 2:36:01,179
If something happens
to my son-in-law,...

1490
2:36:01,246 --> 2:36:03,180
... then anything might happen here.

1491
2:36:03,548 --> 2:36:05,516
What will you do?.

1492
2:36:05,884 --> 2:36:08,853
Ever tell what I'll
do and how I'll do,...

1493
2:36:08,920 --> 2:36:10,854
... you'll know when it happen.

1494
2:36:11,223 --> 2:36:14,852
If a single man comes and do
riots in the minister's house,...

1495
2:36:14,926 --> 2:36:16,860
... you'll keep quiet?.

1496
2:36:17,562 --> 2:36:19,530
Beat and chase him out.

1497
2:36:19,731 --> 2:36:23,030
Yes, I'm a single man.
But to give their life to...

1498
2:36:23,101 --> 2:36:26,036
this single man,...... just peep
and see how many are there.

1499
2:37:12,117 --> 2:37:14,244
Hey, how so much of crowd
come into the city?.

1500
2:37:14,352 --> 2:37:17,253
They forcibly entered as farmers.

1501
2:37:18,623 --> 2:37:22,081
See the Padayappa's army.
This is only a trailer.

1502
2:37:22,961 --> 2:37:24,929
You've not seen the main picture.

1503
2:37:24,996 --> 2:37:26,930
If you see it, you'll be shaken.

1504
2:37:27,632 --> 2:37:31,932
You have political influence.
I have people's influence.

1505
2:37:32,971 --> 2:37:36,270
You live on police's power.
I live on people's power.

1506
2:37:36,975 --> 2:37:41,605
Infront of this power,
your power is nothing.

1507
2:37:42,147 --> 2:37:44,274
Let us see if your power is
strong or mine is strong.

1508
2:37:44,649 --> 2:37:46,617
What are you looking,
shoot everybody.

1509
2:37:47,319 --> 2:37:49,947
How many will you shoot
how many will you shoot.

1510
2:37:50,155 --> 2:37:52,350
See how many police do
you have, how many guns...

1511
2:37:52,424 --> 2:37:55,359
...and how many bullets in it.
How many people can you shoot?.

1512
2:37:55,994 --> 2:37:57,962
Do a small calculation and see.

1513
2:37:58,063 --> 2:38:01,362
If you shoot some also,
the others will smash you.

1514
2:38:02,167 --> 2:38:05,295
Come to our side,
or else you'll also die.

1515
2:38:05,670 --> 2:38:07,638
I won't mind that you
are my father-in-law.

1516
2:38:07,839 --> 2:38:09,966
I'll die peacefully by being
a slipper to this man...

1517
2:38:10,041 --> 2:38:12,134
... rather than being a
father-in-law to a man like you.

1518
2:38:12,210 --> 2:38:14,144
Life will go at anytime.

1519
2:38:14,346 --> 2:38:16,314
Let it go after uniting
such a good pair.

1520
2:38:16,681 --> 2:38:18,649
Shoot me!

1521
2:38:19,017 --> 2:38:20,985
Come on lG sir,
give the shooting order.

1522
2:38:21,186 --> 2:38:23,154
If you shoot four people,
others will run.

1523
2:38:24,022 --> 2:38:26,991
Hey, those who run and jump
are on your side, politics.

1524
2:38:27,192 --> 2:38:29,319
Those on this side
are faithful ones.

1525
2:38:29,694 --> 2:38:32,162
If Padayappa says a word,
we won't shout,...

1526
2:38:32,230 --> 2:38:34,164
... but tear you into piece.

1527
2:38:34,699 --> 2:38:36,667
Don't try to test our man.

1528
2:38:36,868 --> 2:38:39,393
If you try it, we will do anything.
What do you say?.

1529
2:38:42,374 --> 2:38:45,343
What are you waiting for?.
It's an order!

1530
2:38:48,046 --> 2:38:50,014
Sir, why do you think
it is so simple.

1531
2:38:52,050 --> 2:38:54,018
See there.
Already the press people are writing...

1532
2:38:54,085 --> 2:38:56,019
... about what's happening here.

1533
2:38:56,087 --> 2:38:58,021
Onething if you wish, I can only
stop them from getting inside...

1534
2:38:58,089 --> 2:39:00,353
... and secure you, that's all.

1535
2:39:00,725 --> 2:39:02,693
If something happens tomorrow,
I can't answer CM, sir.

1536
2:39:03,228 --> 2:39:07,187
Try to convince your son
and get him married.

1537
2:39:07,399 --> 2:39:09,367
What trying to convince him?.

1538
2:39:09,734 --> 2:39:13,363
If the groom is not interested
how will you get him married.

1539
2:39:13,738 --> 2:39:16,366
Have we come to watch it
and give Rs.5 and Rs. 10 as gift.

1540
2:39:16,741 --> 2:39:18,709
We are silent because
you are a police...

1541
2:39:18,777 --> 2:39:20,711
...otherwise we would
have torn you into pieces.

1542
2:39:22,080 --> 2:39:24,048
Tell them brother.
My brother's smile is more than enough.

1543
2:39:24,115 --> 2:39:25,707
Silently send the groom.

1544
2:39:26,151 --> 2:39:28,381
The groom, brother-in-law,
father-in-law are against you.

1545
2:39:28,453 --> 2:39:30,387
This is your family problem, sir.

1546
2:39:31,089 --> 2:39:33,057
Don't make it a
politics sir, please.

1547
2:39:37,095 --> 2:39:39,461
Mr. Padayappa, there
should be no problem here.

1548
2:39:40,098 --> 2:39:42,066
If the groom agrees,
you can take him with you.

1549
2:39:42,267 --> 2:39:47,466
- Do you wish to go with him?.
- Yes.

1550
2:39:56,114 --> 2:39:58,082
This is POLlCE.

1551
2:40:01,286 --> 2:40:04,414
You would now remember the
drama you staged by fooling...

1552
2:40:04,489 --> 2:40:06,423
... and stopping my
daughter's wedding.

1553
2:40:07,792 --> 2:40:12,252
Once you won.
Good. I woke up.

1554
2:40:13,131 --> 2:40:18,262
Now you would have understood
my way is a unique way.

1555
2:41:00,845 --> 2:41:03,143
Tell all our partymen
and blackcats...

1556
2:41:03,214 --> 2:41:07,810
... that my son's funeral might
take place but not this wedding.

1557
2:41:10,855 --> 2:41:12,823
I'm also coming.
Take the car.

1558
2:41:35,547 --> 2:41:37,515
Hey, cut to the left.

1559
2:41:42,887 --> 2:41:44,855

Put the brake and lift.

1570
2:44:09,701 --> 2:44:11,669
- He escaped from us also, over.
- Go fast!

1571
2:44:12,537 --> 2:44:14,505
See he is coming, hit his car.

1572
2:44:40,565 --> 2:44:43,534
No you are the groom.

2:44:45,737 --> 2:44:48,706
- I've mastered this art.
- No, uncle you are aged.

2:44:50,074 --> 2:44:53,703

You are not aged.

A lady is coming with a gun.
What are you looking at?.

1579
2:48:25,656 --> 2:48:27,248
Come all of you.

1580
2:48:33,631 --> 2:48:36,930
Whatever happens here, nobody
should move from their place.

1581
2:50:06,123 --> 2:50:08,091
Forgive me Padayappa.

1582
2:50:08,726 --> 2:50:12,093
No I'm worthless even
to say your name.

1583
2:50:13,397 --> 2:50:15,865
Since I couldn't possess you...

1584
2:50:15,933 --> 2:50:17,867
... I tried to ruin
you and your family.

1585
2:50:18,903 --> 2:50:20,871
But I failed.

1586
2:50:20,938 --> 2:50:24,874
Even now, I tried to kill
you infront of your eyes.

1587
2:50:24,942 --> 2:50:27,103
Still you tried to save me.

1588
2:50:28,746 --> 2:50:31,715
So you are not a human,
you are a God.

1589
2:50:39,757 --> 2:50:43,056
You thought I would say that.
Never.

1590
2:50:44,762 --> 2:50:46,730
I'm not an ordinary woman.

1591
2:50:48,766 --> 2:50:52,896
This anger will not
end in eighteen,...

1592
2:50:52,970 --> 2:50:54,904
... twenty years not
till the end of life...

1593
2:50:54,972 --> 2:50:56,906
... not even if my life ends.

1594
2:50:57,441 --> 2:51:02,071
I'm not servant Vasundra to
live with a life you gave me.

1595
2:51:12,790 --> 2:51:15,418
Hey, you won in this birth.

1596
2:51:16,794 --> 2:51:19,763
If there is a rebirth,...

1597
2:51:20,464 --> 2:51:25,424
... this Neelambari will
definitely take revenge on you.

1598
2:51:40,818 --> 2:51:43,787
Though how many times
you take rebirth,...

1599
2:51:43,854 --> 2:51:48,791
... a greedy man and a loud
woman have never been happy...

1600
2:51:48,859 --> 2:51:51,123
...there is no such history.

1601
2:51:52,163 --> 2:51:54,131
You didn't live happily
when you were alive.

1602
2:51:55,166 --> 2:51:57,134
Atleast let your soul rest in peace.

1603
2:51:59,170 --> 2:52:01,138
God.

1604
2:52:10,848 --> 2:52:13,476
There are thousands
of obstacles in life.

1605
2:52:13,851 --> 2:52:16,820
Obstacles are your stepping stone.

1606
2:52:16,887 --> 2:52:20,823
There are thousands
of obstacles in life.

1607
2:52:20,891 --> 2:52:24,987
Obstacles are your stepping stone.
